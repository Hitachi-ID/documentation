 McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator extension
Bravura Security Fabric  can provide McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) with in f ormation  regarding
privileged access, certific ation  and w orkflo w  events to display in ePO dashboards. You set this up by
providing ePO with access to the API Service (idapi), and installing an extension, shipped with Bravura
Security Fabric , on the ePO server.
To allow ePO access to the API Service (idapi):
1.Create an individual administrator with the ”IDAPI caller” privilege, for example _EPO_USER . 1.
Ensure the CIDR mask is set.
2.Create a user class for the ePO API account.2.
3.Create an administrator group with the ”Run Reports” privilege and use the user class created in3.
step 2 to de fine  the group membership.
To install the Bravura Security Fabric  ePO extension:
1.Contact support@bravurasecurity.com  to obtain the HitachiIDSuiteExt.zip file. 1.
2.Copy the HitachiIDSuiteExt.zip file to the ePO server. 2.
3.Log into the ePO console as the administrator.3.
4.Install the extension.4.
5.Register the Bravura Security Fabric  server using the API Service endpoint; for example: 5.
http://idm_server/instance/idapi
6.Create a task to import the Bravura Security Fabric  data. 6.
7.Run the task or wait for the scheduled e x ecution. 7.
The McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator and extension can only target a single Bravura Security Fabric
instance.
The dashboards supplied are samples of what can be displayed. You can modify, add, or remove
dashboards using ePO softw ar e.  Refer to the McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator documen t ation  for ins tructions
on how to customize the dashboards.Part IV UTILITIES
Using Bravura Security Fabric  utilities
Bravura Security Fabric  includes a large c ollection  of tools to assist Bravura Security Fabric  administrators
with server maintenance and advanced adminis tr ation  tasks. These tools are all Win32 executable
programs and are located in the util directory of your ins t allation.
Some of these programs can damage your instance or file system if used incorrectly. Ensure that you have
followed all of the ins tructions  carefully before you start using these tools.
Using the command line
All of the Bravura Security Fabric  tools are executed from a command-line interface. That is, you type
ins tructions  at command prompt, rather than using your mouse to select GUI elements such as buttons
or icons.
One such command-line interface is the Bravura Security Fabric Command Prompt, which is the Windows
Command Prompt pr ec on figur ed  for the Bravura Security Fabric  environment.
Launching the Bravura Security Fabric  Command Prompt
To open a new instance of the command prompt, search cmd  and select Bravura Security Fabric
Command PromptA window appears with a blinking cursor in the Bravura Security Fabric  instance directory.
You can now type an MS-DOS command at the prompt (>). To navigate to the util directory, use the cd
(change directory) command. For example, type:
cd util
See your Windows documen t ation  for more in f ormation  about MS-DOS commands.Using an alt ernativ e  command-line interface
You may choose to use a custom command-line interface, such as the Bash Shell (bash.exe) provided with
Cygwin, instead of the Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe). Be aware that some command-line
interfaces interpret special characters ("\/|.$) diff er en tly .
Unless otherwise stated, all examples in this manual assume that you are e x ecuting  the program from a
Windows 200x Command Prompt. If you use a custom command-line interface, you may need to modify
some of the examples to work properly.
