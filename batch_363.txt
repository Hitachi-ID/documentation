such as ffmpeg ,  by changing the value of SMON VIDEO CREATE COMMAND LINE in the Manage the
system > Modules > Recorded session management (smon)  menu.
You can run smonavi with the -l argument from the command line to get a list of the codecs available
on the system. The smonavi program prints a + symbol next to codecs that can be used to create
video from screenshots captured during a recorded session; it prints a - symbol next to installed codecs
that are not c ompatible.  If none of the e xisting  codecs can be used, it is recommended that you install
additional  codecs.
Usage
smonavi.exe -l
smonavi.exe -r <frames per second rate>  -i <image name pattern>  -
f <output file>  -c <codec code>
Argument Description
-c Code of codec to use. This must be a 4-character code
that is in the list of available codecs returned with the -l
option.
-f <file> Output file name
-i <pattern> Image name pattern
-l List the available codecs on the system. smonavi prints a
+ symbol next to usable codecs.
-r <rate> The rate of frames per second
Example
The default command de fined  by the SMON VIDEO CREATE COMMAND LINE is:
smonavi.exe -r %fps% -i %pattern%_*.png -f %path% -c %codec%
Where:
▪%fps  is the frames per second at which the session was recorded. ▪
▪%pattern  is the start of the file names that will be consistent for all images in a single video. ▪
This allows smonavi to determine which images came from what display when multiple  displays are
used.
▪%path  is a loc ation  in the directory specified  by SMON TEMP STORAGE PATH in the Manage the ▪
system > Modules > Recorded session management  (SMON) menu.
▪%codec%  is replaced by the value of SMON VIDEO CREATE CODEC CODE in the Manage the system ▪
> Modules > Recorded session management  (SMON ) menu.
The msvc codec is recommended for t esting  only. To see what other codecs you have available, run
the smonavi utility  with the -l argument.smonc
The smonc program receives session monitoring data from user w ork s t ations.  It provides support for:
▪ Collecting  monitored session data ▪
▪ V alidation  of w orkflo w  requests to ensure users are still allowed to have privileged access ▪
▪Remote t ermination  if a user’s access is checked in ▪
The session monitoring client on the user’s w ork s t ation  connects to smonc on the Bravura Security
Fabric  server. You can specify the c onnection  URL in Manage the system > Privileged access > Options
> General > SMON HTTP URL .
smonclean
The smonclean program permanently deletes session monitoring packages that meet a given age
threshold. This applies to both the database and files on the files y s t em.  When sessions are older than x
number of days, any single and multi-session  packages that contain the session are removed, and the
session itself will no longer be available to be viewed or downloaded.
Multi-session  packages will be removed if at least one of its sessions meet the age threshold, regardless
of whether it contains other sessions that do not meet the age threshold. Sessions will not be removed if
there are activ e  packages still retained. They can be forcibly removed by passing in an additional  flag
argument.
Usage
smonclean.exe -d <number of days old>
Argument Description
-d <number of days old> Sessions at least this many days old will be permanently
deleted. Accepts values between 1-24855.
-f Proceed with session removal even if there are activ e
packages still retained. If flag is not set, the process will
abort and record the details in the instance log.
Examples
1.To delete sessions and its packages older than 30 days:1.
smonclean.exe -d 30
2.To force delete sessions and its packages older than 5 days, regardless of whether there are activ e 2.
packages retained:
smonclean.exe -d 5 -fsmonmove
The smonmove program changes the loc ation  of the session monitoring data in the database from one
node to another. You might need to do this in a recovery scenario where a r eplic ation  node containing
session monitoring data gets decommissioned and needs to be copied to an activ e  r eplic ation  node.
In addition  to running this program, the following directories need to be manually copied from the old
node to the new node:
▪smon\screenshot▪
▪smon\webcam▪
Packages that were already generated will not be copied over. These will need to be requested again by
the end-user.
Usage
smonavi.exe -list
smonavi.exe -sourcenode <node ID of source managing node> -
destnode <node ID of destination managing node> -move
Argument Description
-destnode <nodeID> The node ID to move session monitoring data to.
-force Move session monitoring data even if it is incomplete (ie.
session is currently activ e  or stale). Moving incomplete
data may cause issues with package g ener ation.
-list Display a list of valid source and destination  node IDs.
-move Move session monitoring data.
-sourcenode <nodeID> The node ID to move session monitoring data from.
Examples
1.To list the IDs of the source and destination  nodes: 1.
smonmove.exe -list
2.To move session monitoring data from one node to another:2.
smonmove.exe -sourcenode <nodeID> -destnode <nodeID> -move
3.To force all session monitoring data to be moved from one node to another, regardless of the session3.
status:
 smonmove.exe -sourcenode <nodeID> -destnode <nodeID> -move -force
smonprocessmeta
When session monitoring is enabled, the smonprocessmeta  program processes harvested data and
inserts the data into the database in a series of batch oper ations.  If a signific an t  amount of data has beencollected, this could result in signific an t  work for the database. smonprocessmeta  executes
periodically while a session monitoring session is activ e.  Text-based data such as keystroke, clipboard and
UI data will not be available to search engines or in zip packages until  smonprocessmeta  is executed.

smonsavemeta
smonsavemeta creates session data packages when requested from the Recorded session management
(SMON) module, and fir es  any additional  utilities  such as smonavi or another video g ener ation  utility .
It is not intended to be run manually from the command line.
User management utilities
acctena
Use the acctena program to immediately unlock users that have locked themselves out of Bravura
Security Fabric  (intruder lockout). You can also use this program to disable a specified  user’s pr ofile  ID.
The acctena program does not enable users that have been disabled explicitly by the help desk or by
this program.
