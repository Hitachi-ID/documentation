de fined  in the en-us-errmsg.kvg file. By default these tags are commented out. They are de fined  as
follows for the value of N:
▪N = 0  A return code of 0 signifies  success. Success messages often  return various warnings. You may or ▪
may not want users to see these warning messages. To suppress the warnings, create a custom
success message by modifying the error_agent_0 tag.
▪N = 1,2,3...  P ositiv e  values for N indicate various errors. When a return code of N is returned by a ▪
connector, the corresponding error_agent_<N> message is displayed.
To create a custom connector error or success message, follow the procedure outlined in Altering text by
editing  KVG files (on page 3489). Ensure that you uncomment the values that you want to modify.
Creating  a custom message overrides all extra inf ormation  returned by the connector, including any
warning messages that are returned.
Example: Suppress success messages
For example, to suppress any warnings that might be included in success messages, create a custom en-
us-errmsg.kvg  file as follows:
# KVGROUP-V1.0
"language" "EN_US" = {
  "ERROR_AGENT_0" "" = {
    "text" = "Success"
}
E diting  email content
Default email message text is controlled by the Bravura Security Fabric  . You can:
▪Use the Manage the system  (PSA) module to customize w orkflo w  email content ▪
▪Edit custom KVGroup files to modify any message subject and content, or prevent Bravura Security ▪
Fabric  from sending specific  types of email
Customize w orkflow  email using the Manage the system (PSA) module
The Email cus t omiz ation  page provides easy access to w orkflo w  email language macros so that you can

Edit KVGroup files  to customize messages
You can edit custom KVGroup files to customize any email message.
Message content
Like GUI message text, the content of email messages is de fined  in <lang>-<locale>-
errmsg.kvg . To change the content of a message, follow the procedure outlined in Altering text by
editing  KVG files (on page 3489) to create a custom <lang>-<locale>-errmsg.kvg file. Generally, email
subject tags include _SUBJECT_ , and corresponding body text tags include _CONTENT_ .
If more in f ormation  is required in email messages, then the following sub stitutions  are available:
▪ %RE CIPIENT_<attrid>%  – the recipient of the request ▪
▪ %RE QUE S TER_<attrid>%  – the requester of the request ▪
▪ %EMAIL_RE CIPIENT_<attrid>%  – the recipient of the email; the "To:". ▪
P r e v enting  email from being sent
You can prevent Bravura Security Fabric  from sending specific  types of emails by adding the appropriate
tag, with no content, to your custom <lang>-<locale>-errmsg.kvg  file. Finding where to edit
(on page 3495) shows you how to locate the appropriate tag.
For example, to prevent Bravura Security Fabric  from sending "Thank-you" emails to reviewers after  a
certific ation  campaign has been reviewed:
1.Open the en-us-errmsg.kvg file. 1.
2.Retrieve this tag:2.
"EM_WORKFLOW_CERT_THANKYOU_AUTHORIZER_THANKYOU_CONTENT_PRIMARY_ACTOR"
"" =   {  
   "text" = "EM_CERT_THANKYOU_CONTENT"  
  }
3.Empty the text:3.
"EM_WORKFLOW_CERT_THANKYOU_AUTHORIZER_THANKYOU_CONTENT_PRIMARY_ACTOR"
"" =  
 {  
   "text" = ""  
  }
4.Stop the W orkflo w  Manager Service (idwfm). 4.
5.Generate the skin files;  for example: 5.
make.bat default en-us 
make.bat install default en-us
6.Start the W orkflo w  Manager Service. 6.
Edit text for password rule names and descriptions
You can edit and modify password policy rule names. This changes the rule name that appears on the
Password policy rules page, and the rule description  that appears on the Test passwords and Change
password pages.
1.Find the tag name of the rule that you want to change:1.
a.In the \<instance>\design\ directory, regenerate the skins in debug mode by e x ecuting  the a.
following commands:
make.bat debug default en-us 
make.bat install en-us
b.Click Manage the system > Policies > Password policies . b.
c.Select a password policy and click the Password policy  tab. c.
d.Use the "Inspect element" or an equivalent option  in your web browser to see the current HTML d.
source.
"View page source" or an equivalent option  cannot be used as it will not show the relevant HTML
code and debug comments.
e.Search for the text you want to modify to find the tag name. The tag name is indicated by e.
[PWID]=[<tag>] .
The PWID and PWRULE lines only appear in the source code after  the skins have been regenerated
in debug mode.
For example, if you want to change the name "have at least N characters", then search for those
words in the web page HTML source. The search finds  this section:
[PROGRAM]=[psa.exe] 
[PWID]=[MINPASSLENGTH] [PWNAME]=[pnMINPASSLENGTH] 
[PWRULE]=[have at least N characters]
In this case, the tag name is MINPASSLENGTH.
2.Search for the tag name found in step 1e in en-us-errmsg.kvg , located in the 2.
\<instance>\design\src\common directory. The rule names use the following naming c on v ention:
STRENGTH_<tag>_RULE.
3.Create a custom en-us-errmsg.kvg  file in the \<instance>\design\custom\ directory to overwrite 3.
the rule name with your custom text.
4.Add the following outer KVGroup to your custom en-us-errmsg.kvg  file: 4.
# KVGROUP-V1.0 
"language" "EN_US" = { 
}
5.Add a KVGroup to overwrite the name for the tag found in step 1e. Use the naming c on v ention 5.
STRENGTH_<tag>_RULE_USER to override the default en-us-errmsg.kvg  file.
For example, add the following KVGroup to the custom en-us-errmsg.kvg  file to change the rule
name for the example found in step 1e:
"language" "EN_US" = { 
"STRENGTH_MINPASSLENGTH_RULE_USER" "" = { 
  "text" = "the password must have at least %STRENGTH_MINPASSLENGTH_RULE_INTVAL
% characters" 
   } 
}
6.Save and close the custom KVGroup file. 6.
7.Generate and install the skins7.
To generate and install new or modified  skin files,  use the following format for the commands to run
from the <instance>\design\ directory, where en-us  is American English:
1.Compile the skins:1.
make.bat default en-us
Changes are saved in the instance's <instance>\design\skin\ directory
2.Install the skins:2.
make.bat install default en-us
The compiled files are copied to the instance's skin\ directory
3.If necessary, reload and review any changes to Bravura Security Fabric  web pages. 3.
Do not run the second command to install the skins if they fail to compile, especially if the firs t m4
file (links.m4) fails to compile.
Skins can fail to compile if something in the environment is locking the skin files.  That can be a
malware program, an automated backup tool running at the time,  but more likely the product UI itself
being in use at the time  of the skin c ompilationHave a test instance where you can compile the skins when the instance is not being used. Make a
backup copy of the files on the production  instance in case you need to quickly roll them back. Review
changes on the test instance, then copy the skin files to the production  instance.
.
Make report columns hidden by default
Bravura Security Fabric  allows you to make columns hidden by default in any report that is available in
the applic ation;  end-users can display the columns at any time  via the [Show / Hide columns] menu.
To hide a column by default:
1.Open the reportHeaderVisibilityConfig.js  file located in the \<instance>\design\src\js\ 1.
directory.
2.Modify the defaultReportColumnVisibility  variable using the following format: 2.
<report exec name>: [list of columns to hide]
For example:
var defaultReportColumnVisibility = {
ACCOUNT: [angular.language._NPHPSA_USER_ID___,
angular.language.C_TGROUP],
MEMBERSHIP: [angular.language._NPHPSA_GROUPID__,angular.language.
_NPHIDC_GROUP_DESC,’Path’]};
You can use the column names as they appear in the report, but if other languages are installed for
the applic ation,  you can use the KVG language tags. ACCOUNT and MEMBERSHIP are IDs of reports
and can be obtained by calling the command from browser console: $(’div[data-
name="ReportInputTable"]’).attr(’id’)
3.Save the file and run the following two commands: 3.
make.bat default en-us
make.bat install default en-us
4.Test the result by opening the report specified  in the reportHeaderVisibilityConfig.js 4.
filePart III ADD-ONSGroup Management Shell Extension
The Bravura Security Shell Extension  works in c onjunction  with Bravura Group  to allow e fficien t  access to
protected network resources, for example – folders/shares, managed Activ e  Directory groups, printers,
etc.
Once installed, the Shell Extension is embedded into the oper ating  system. Instead of logging into
Bravura Group , r equesting  access is as simple as a right-click or double click on the protected resource.
Using the Shell Extension facilitates a simpler user experience. Users are led directly to the Bravura
Group  page for the network resource to which they want to request access. Previously, users needed a
better  working knowledge of Bravura Group  in order to perform the same task.
The Shell Extension integrates seamlessly with the oper ating  system and is a transparent addition  to
Bravura Group .
All shared resources will reveal the “Request Access” option  when opening the context menu by right-
clicking the resource.
Before the Shell Extension can be installed, you must have the following installed:
▪Bravura Group▪
▪“Windows Activ e  Directory DN” connector ( agtaddn ) from the Connector Pack – see the Connector ▪
Pack Documen t ation
▪ Activ e  Directory – see the Connector Pack Documen t ation ▪
The Shell Extension supports both 32 bit and 64 bit systems, including Windows 7/Vista and newer.
You can install the Shell Extension softw ar e:
▪Manually installing the Shell Extension  (on page 3528) ▪
▪Installing aut omatic ally  (on page 3530) ▪
Manually installing the Shell Extension
1.Download the hidshext.msi installer to the client w ork s t ation.  If the client w ork s t ation  is running 1.
64-bit Windows, use hidshext-x64.msi instead.
The installer is located in the addon directory. If it is not, ensure that the add-ons subfeature of
Bravura Group  was selected during ins t allation,  or run the Bravura Security Fabric  installer again,
modify the installed instance, and select it.
2.Launch the MSI installer with administrator privileges.2.

Installing aut omatic ally
You can easily deploy Shell Extension to a group of users or computers using a Windows group policy to
automate the ins t allation  of the client softw ar e.  If you want the MSI installer to install aut omatic ally  with
no end-user in t er action,  you must set ins t allation  options  by applying a Windows Installer Transform file
(.mst) or by modifying the MSI installer with an MSI editor. The installer must be run with adminis tr ativ e
privileges.
