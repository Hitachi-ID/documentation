▪simulatekeypress will be supported, but not in Phase 1. A warning message will be given when▪
pswxdom2webapp finds  a Browser Driver disclosure that has this setting  enabled. A web app will be
created, but running it may cause issues if the website relies on keypresses to log in.
▪If a semicolon is used as a submitbuttonids  rather than an HTML tag, it will no longer work on web ▪
app. This will need to be replaced with an explicit HTML tag.
Usage
pswxdom2webapp.exe [-pr e fix]  [- file]  [-force]
Argument Description
-pr e fix Pr e fix  the web app’s name with the specified  value.
- file Convert Browser Driver disclosure c on figur ation  to JSON
files.  This is added to <ins t ance>/w ebapp files.  This does
not commit changes to the database. The JSON files
generated can be used to manually create web apps.
-force Override e xisting  changes made to the database or
converted web app files.
Converted global-level Browser Driver disclosure plug-ins will be named: <disclosure plugin> . If
the -pr e fix  argument is used, they will be named: <prefix><disclosure-plugin> . Description  of
the web app will be: Webappjson generated for <disclosure plugin> .
Converted MSP-level Browser Driver disclosure plugins will be named: managed system policy -
<disclosure plugin> . If the -pr e fix  argument is used, they will be named: <prefix> managed
system policy -<disclosure-plugin> . Description  of the web app will be: Webappjson
generated for managed system policy  / <disclosure plugin>.
If a web app was already generated for a specific  Browser Driver disclosure using pswxdom2webapp , it
will not be generated again unless -force is used.

rmidarchivepwdhis
The rmidarchivepwdhis  program is used to trim an account’s archived password history to the most
recent <N> passwords, where N is set by the RESOURCE PASSWORD HISTORY NUMBER managed system
policy option.  By default, all passwords are archived. You can also run this program to remove only failed
passwords of an account. You must run rmidarchivepwdhi s manually or as a scheduled task to

privileged passwords from the Bravura Privilege  vault and use them to execute scripts and command-line
programs.
See Applic ation  accounts  (on page 2049) for details.

This utility  updates the service ID in the following tables:
▪lws_mon_wstn▪
▪lwsworkingrule▪
▪pamgrpco▪▪pamgrpmbr▪
▪pammaqco▪
▪resmng▪
▪wstncogrpmbr▪

validsvcid <validsvcid>
uuidutil
Use the uuidutil  program to manually change the UUID (Universal Unique Identifier).
Every discovered computer in Bravura Privilege is identified  with a GUID (Global Unique Identifier)  and a
UUID. The UUID is generated at initial  r egis tr ation  time  and saved:
▪push-mode - the UUID is a string version of the GUID ▪
▪pull-mode -  the UUID is the hostname of the computer. ▪
In the case of pull-mode, a discovered computer could become re-purposed and have its hostname
changed; however the UUID will remain the same. If another computer is added using the originalhostname, then two computers will have the same UUID, causing a c on flict.  Use the uuidutil
program to manually change the UUID, which will resolve the c on flict.
Usage
uuidutil.e x e  argument Description
-system <system> The system's GUID
-uuid <uuid> The system's UUID
-change Change a UUID
-query Query a UUID or system
Examples
1.Use uuidutil  in -query  mode to determine the GUID: 1.
uuidutil.exe -query -uuid WEBSERVER-06
2.Use uuidutil  in -query  mode to determine the UUID: 2.
uuidutil.exe -query -system 47bf558e-7e54-4264-ad02-7cf1cda4a5db
3.Use uuidutil in -change  mode. In this mode -system  is the GUID for the system you want to 3.
modify and -uuid  is the new UUID you want to change it to:
uuidutil.exe -change -uuid MAILSERVER-03 -system 47bf558e-7e54-4264-
ad02-7cf1cda4a5db
wstnpwdinit
Use the wstnpwdinit  program to inject an initial  password into Bravura Privilege  managed accounts
without a password.
Usage

Argument Description
-msp managed system policy The managed system policy. (Required)
-password <pwd> The password value. (Required)

Report utilities
c on figur eanalytics
Use the configureanalytics program to upload and download custom reports between the
Bravura Security Fabric  server and the SQL Server R eporting  Services (SSRS) report server.
A report file that exists on the report server can be viewed in the Analytics  app. If users need to access
the same reports from each r eplic ation  node, a copy of the report file must also exist on the Bravura
Security Fabric  applic ation  server.
This program is also run by setup during ins t allation  and upgrade.
Note that to publish successfully custom reports from instance server to report server these custom
reports of file extension rdl must:
1.Have the phrase HID-REPLACE.... in the proper format as shown below:1.
   <DataSources> 
    <DataSource Name="idmsuite"> 
     <DataSourceReference>/HID-REPLACE:ReportServer/DataSources/
idmsuite 
     </DataSourceReference> 
         <rd:SecurityType>None</rd:SecurityType> 
    </DataSource> 
   </DataSources>
2.Be under one or more sub-folders of the folder2.
C:\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\instancename\analytics
\ReportItems
Usageconfigureanalytics.exe [options]
Argument Description
-delete Delete a report. Used in c onjunction  with - file.
- file File to upload or delete.
-init Initializ ation  mode. This command is used by the installer
during ins t allation.
-override Override current version. Used in c onjunction  with -
upload.
-publish Provides a list of reports, which you can then choose to
upload to the SSRS server or Bravura Security Fabric
server.
-upgrade Upgrade mode. This command is used by the installer
during a product upgrade.
-upload Upload a report to the SSRS server. Used in c onjunction
with - file.
Examples
Publish
In this example:
1.Bravura Security Fabric  applic ation  server A connects to SSRS report server A. 1.
2. Applic ation  server A has files for two reports: "Dog" and "Sunset". 2.
3.The report server has one report file: "Horse". 3.
4.The Bravura Security Fabric  Analytics  page shows only the "Horse" report; that is, the report that has a 4.
file on the report server.5.Use the command configureanalytics.exe -publish  to see a list of report files. 5.
In this example, two files,  "Dog" and "Sunset" are missing from the report server, and one report file,
"Horse", is missing from the applic ation  server.
6.Type the number corresponding the item you want to upload to the report server (in the example,6.
items 1 or 3), or download to the applic ation  server (in the example, item 2), then press [Enter] .
The file is uploaded or downloaded to the appropriate server.
See REPORTS  (on page 2891) for more in f ormation  about synchronizing files between r eplic ation  nodes.
Upload
To upload a file to the report server from the Bravura Security Fabric  applic ation  server:

\PRIVILEGED\ACCESS\pam.rdl
Override  
To upload a diff er en t  version of a report that already exists on the report server:configureanalytics.exe -upload -file ReportItems\ANALYTICS\CATEGORY
\PRIVILEGED\ACCESS\pam.rdl -override
Delete  
To delete a file from the report server:
configureanalytics.exe -file ReportItems\ANALYTICS\CATEGORY\PRIVILEGED
