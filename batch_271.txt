Part IX MAINTENANCE1 Scheduling maintenance
Product administrators use the Maintenance > Scheduled jobs menu to schedule programs or jobs to run
on one or more Bravura Security Fabric  servers.
You require the Maintain servers adminis tr ativ e  privilege in order to access the Maintenance menu.
Scheduled jobs are executed by the Scheduler Service. The service checks for new or updated jobs to run
at specified  intervals (default is 10 minutes). You can c on figur e  this interval, or start and stop the service,
by accessing the Scheduler Service page from the Maintenance > Services  menu.
The Scheduler Service  (on page 2869) is started and c onfigured  aut omatic ally  when Bravura Security
Fabric is installed. In order for a job to execute, the service must be running.
You can also click Run now on the Scheduled job in f ormation  page to immediately launch a scheduled
job.  
About the default scheduled jobs
Bravura Security Fabric  creates some jobs aut omatic ally ,  including:▪Clean session data files (on page 2703) ▪
▪Dashboard s t atistics  daily update  (on page 2703) ▪
▪autores  (on page 2704) ▪
▪psupdate  (on page 2705) ▪
▪ p w dc on flicts  (on page 2710) ▪
▪rotatelog  (on page 2711) ▪
▪psdonechk  (on page 2712) ▪
▪rotatelog-proxy  (on page 2712) ▪
Clean session data files
This job runs the cleansessdata  utility  to removed session files older than the greater of
DEFAULT_EXPIRY_SECONDS or DEFAULT_API_SESS_EXPIRY_SECONDS. If neither system variable is set, it
will use the DEFAULT_EXPIRY_SECONDS default, which is 600.
See cleansessdata
The cleansessdata program is run nightly by the Scheduler Service ( psscheduler ) to removed
session files older than the greater of DEFAULT_EXPIRY_SECONDS or
DEFAULT_API_SESS_EXPIRY_SECONDS. If neither system variable is set, it will use the
DEFAULT_EXPIRY_SECONDS default, which is 600.
You can modify the scheduled job at Manage the system > Maintenance > Scheduled jobs .
Usage
cleansessdata.exe [-h] [-v] [-debug]
for command-line usage.
Dashboard s t atistics  daily update
This job runs the dashboardstats  utility  to calculate cached data for dashboards. By default it is
scheduled to run daily at 11:00 pm on the primary Bravura Security Fabric  server.
You can modify the Job to run to suit your environment. A separate scheduled job must be created if the
dashboardstats  utility  is run more than once a day.
See dashboardstats
Use the dashboardstats program to recalculate the cached data for dashboards regardless of the
Manage the system  > Maintenance > System variables  > DASHBOARD CACHE VALIDITY INTERVAL  or
DASHBOARD CACHE MAX DELAY system variables.
The following dashboards have cached data and will be a ff ect ed  by the dashboardstats program:
▪Manage the system▪
▪Privileged access▪
▪Manage certific ation  process ▪
▪View w orkflo w  dashboard ▪This does not a ff ect  Bravura Group .
Usage
dashboardstats.exe [-forcerun]
Examples
1.To recalculate the dashboard caches:1.
dashboardstats.exe
2.To recalculate the dashboard caches on a node other than the primary server:2.
dashboardstats.exe -forcerun
for command-line usage.
autores
 Applies to Bravura Identity  
 Applies to Bravura Privilege
This job executes the autores -all -submit command. The command will calculate the
aut omatic  assignment  (on page 2442) for c on figur ed  roles and groups and submit requests based on
results.
By default, this job is scheduled to run daily at 03:30 am on one Bravura Security Fabric  server.  
See autores
Use the autores program to determine the aut omatic  role and group de ficits  and surpluses and issue
requests. When aut omatic  assignment is c on figur ed,  the program is run aut omatic ally  at the end of the
auto discovery process.
Usage
autores.exe -all [-submit | [-limitsubmit <max submissions> | -
outfile <outfile> ] | -listfile <listfile> ] [-threshold <N>]
autores.exe -group <targetid> <groupid> [-submit | [-
limitsubmit <max submissions> | -outfile <outfile> ] | -

-role <role id> Act on the specified  role.
-deleteonly Aut omatic  unassignment to a specified  role.
-inputfile  <inputfile> File containing changes to submit.
-submit Submit the requests for changes.
-limitsubmit <max submissions> Limit the number of requests generated. Will override
AUTO ASSIGNMENT MAXSUBMIT DEFAULT setting.
-listfile  <listfile> File to output violations  to (default is autores.kvg).
-outfile  <outfile> Output file for printing  all violations  that did not get
submitted  along with the error message returned.
(default is aut or es-unsubmitted.kv g)
-threshold <N> Do not submit any request if number of requests to be
submitted  exceeds <N>. If N= 0, no threshold. Using this
setting  overrides the AUTO ASSIGNMENT THRESHOLD
system variable.

for command-line usage.
psupdate
This job runs the psupdate program, which initia t es  and controls the auto discovery  process  (on page
2716). By default, this job is scheduled to run daily at 1:30 am. Bravura Security Fabric  aut omatic ally
creates the psupdate job when you add your fir s t target system, and c on figur es  it to run on the serverfrom where you added the target system. You cannot delete this job, nor can you modify the Job to run
or Directory to run job in  settings.
In a replicated environment, it is aut omatic ally  set to run only on the fir s t server on which auto discovery
is run. It should never be run on two servers at the same time.  Before running, psupdate will check
whether it is scheduled to run on some other node, and will abort if so. Psupdate cannot be reassigned
to other nodes while auto discovery or persistent listing  are currently running.
The psupdate program also executes the autores -all -submit  command. The command will
calculate the aut omatic  assignment  (on page 2442) for c on figur ed  roles and groups and submit requests
based on results.
Note: You can change the server  (on page 2715) that the psupdate job is run on;
however, do not c on figur e  it to run on multiple  servers.   
See psupdate
The psupdate program initia t es  and controls the auto discovery process. It is responsible for calling a
series of programs and PSLang scripts, which in turn, control e x ecution  of each auto discovery task.
These tasks include:
▪Refreshing proxy servers▪
▪ Listing  in f ormation  from managed systems ▪
▪Evaluate the import rules on discovered systems and accounts and assign them to managed system▪
policies
▪Monitoring list file size ▪
▪ Con figuring  listed computer objects as Bravura Privilege resources ▪
▪ Updating  the Bravura Security Fabric database ▪
▪ De t ecting  out-of-band changes ▪
▪Cleaning up the database▪
▪Checking inventory levels▪
▪Loading user class cache▪
▪ Submitting  aut omatic  assignment requests ▪
▪Synchronize server files and registry keys ▪
▪ Notif ying  the Bravura Security Fabric administrator of errors or warnings ▪
▪ Cr eating  the default scheduled task to run psupdate ▪
You can also run psupdate to update a single user.
Never run psupdate on more than one replicated Bravura Security Fabric server at the same time
In a replic ation  environment, the sending node creates additional  queue files in the <ins t anc e>/db/
replic ation  directory. These are used to store the data to be sent to all replic ation  nodes. Once this data
has been replicated to the nodes, these files are removed.
