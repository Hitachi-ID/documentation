When a request is made, Bravura Security Fabric  can send emails to authorizers:
▪As soon as each stage of the w orkflo w  is reached. The Notif y  this user immediately option  is set by ▪
default for individual authorizers.
▪At or during specified  mail times;  for example if mail times  are set for 9:00,13:00,16:00, and a new ▪
request requiring approval comes in at:
▪8:15, the authorizer gets the email at 9:00.▪
▪9:15, the authorizer gets the email at 13:00.▪
▪17:15, the authorizer gets it at 9:00 the following day.▪If mail time  is set for the period between 9:00-17:00, and a new request requiring approval comes
in at:
▪8:15, the authorizer gets the email at 9:00.▪
▪9:15, the authorizer gets the email at 9:15.▪
▪17:15, the authorizer gets it at 9:00 the following day.▪
The times  are set either for individual authorizers by the Times of day to email or globally by the
REMINDER TIME .
Bravura Security Fabric  also sends reminder emails, after  the initial  email has been sent, at intervals set
by the global REMINDER INTERVAL . This is the minimum time  between reminders. The default interval is
24 hours.
If you alter the reminder times  or interval, messages that have already been queued will be sent at the
previously set time.  The new time  values apply to messages triggered after  you make the changes.
Modifying privileged access management settings  for sending email
You can c on figur e  settings  for email notific ations  related to adminis tr ativ e  password management by
clicking the Options  > Email tab on a managed system policy c on figur ation  page.

E diting  email messages
Default email message text is controlled by the Bravura Security Fabric  skins . You can:
▪Use the Manage the system  (PSA) module to customize w orkflo w  email content ▪▪Edit custom KVGroup files to modify any message subject and content, or prevent Bravura Security ▪
Fabric  from sending specific  types of email
Customizing w orkflo w  email using the Manage the system (PSA) module
The Email cus t omiz ation  page provides easy access to w orkflo w  email language macros so that you can
customize them without manually modifying any KVGroup files.
To customize w orkflo w  email macros using the Email cus t omiz ation  page:
1.Click Manage the system > W orkflo w  > Email cus t omiz ation . 1.
2.Select values in at least one category of Type , Status , or P articipan t . 2.
You can search all values in a category by leaving it set to “(Select one)”.
The values are described in the table below.
3.Click Select . 3.
If the values you selected match any email macros, they are displayed below. The w orkflo w  email tag
names use the following format: EM_WORKFLOW_ <type> _<status> _ <participan t> _*. If there are no
matches found, modify the category values and Select again.
Each macro has a Default and Custom value. The Default value cannot be modified.
4.Enable the Custom field  and type values as required. 4.
You can copy and paste values from the Default field.
5.Enable the Generate skin checkbox, at the bottom  of the table, if you want to generate the Bravura 5.
Security Fabric  skins now.
6.Click Update . 6.
If you chose to generate the skin, your cus t omiz ations  are written  to the <lang >-<locale >-
errmsg.kvg file in the <instance>\design\custom\  directory, for the language currently
displayed in the browser.

Undoing w orkflo w  email cus t omiz ations
To reverse a cus t omiz ation  to a w orkflo w  email and return the message to it’s default value:
1.Locate the appropriate macro, as described on Customizing w orkflo w  email using the Manage the 1.
system  (on page 423).
2.Enable the Default field. 2.
3.Enable the Generate skin checkbox, at the bottom  of the table, if you want to generate the Bravura 3.
Security Fabric  skins now.
4.Click Update . 4.
If you chose to generate the skin, your cus t omiz ations  are deleted from the appropriate <lang >-
<locale >-errmsg.kvg file in the <instance>\design\\ custom\  directory.
E diting  KVGroup files  to customize messages
You can edit custom KVGroup files to customize any email message. See the CUSTOMIZATION  (on page
3471) for more detailed in f ormation  about editing  these files.Message content
Like GUI message text, the content of email messages is de fined  in <lang >-<locale >-errmsg.kvg . To
change the content of a message, follow the procedure outlined in CUSTOMIZATION  (on page 3471) to
create a custom <lang >-<locale >-errmsg.kvg  file. Generally, email subject tags include _SUBJECT_ ,
and corresponding body text tags include _CONTENT_ .
If more in f ormation  is required in email messages, then the following sub stitutions  are available:
▪ %RE CIPIENT_<attrid>%  – the recipient of the request ▪
▪ %RE QUE S TER_<attrid>%  – the requester of the request ▪
▪ %EMAIL_RE CIPIENT_<attrid>%  – the recipient of the email; the ”To:”. ▪
Pr e v enting  email from being sent
You can prevent Bravura Security Fabric  from sending specific  types of emails by adding the appropriate
tag, with no content, to your custom <lang >-<locale >-errmsg.kvg file. The CUSTOMIZATION  (on
page 3471) shows you how to locate the appropriate tag.
For example, to prevent Bravura Security Fabric  from sending ”Thank-you” emails to reviewers after  a
certific ation  campaign has been reviewed:
1.Open the en-us-errmsg.kvg file. 1.
2.Retrieve this tag:2.
"EM_WORKFLOW_CERT_THANKYOU_AUTHORIZER_THANKYOU_CONTENT_PRIMARY_ACTOR""
" =
{
"text" = "EM_CERT_THANKYOU_CONTENT"
}
3.Empty the text:3.
"EM_WORKFLOW_CERT_THANKYOU_AUTHORIZER_THANKYOU_CONTENT_PRIMARY_ACTOR""
" =
{
"text" = " "
}
4.Stop the W orkflo w  Manager Service ( idwfm ). 4.
5.Generate the skin files 5.
To generate and install new or modified  skin files,  use the following format for the commands to run
from the <instance>\design\ directory, where en-us  is American English:
1.Compile the skins:1.
make.bat default en-us
Changes are saved in the instance's <instance>\design\skin\ directory
2.Install the skins:2.make.bat install default en-us
The compiled files are copied to the instance's skin\ directory
3.If necessary, reload and review any changes to Bravura Security Fabric  web pages. 3.
Do not run the second command to install the skins if they fail to compile, especially if the firs t m4
file (links.m4) fails to compile.
Skins can fail to compile if something in the environment is locking the skin files.  That can be a
malware program, an automated backup tool running at the time,  but more likely the product UI itself
being in use at the time  of the skin c ompilation
Have a test instance where you can compile the skins when the instance is not being used. Make a
backup copy of the files on the production  instance in case you need to quickly roll them back. Review
changes on the test instance, then copy the skin files to the production  instance.
.
6.Start the W orkflo w  Manager Service. 6.

Email block list
Updated v12.2.1
Bravura Security Fabric  can block emails being sent to a specific  address or a group of addresses; for
example, undeliverable addresses. Two types of block lists can be used:
▪Single address▪
▪Regular expression pattern ▪
To c onfigur e  an email block list
You c on figur e  email block lists in the hid_global_c on figur ation  table in the Manage external data store
(DBE) module. Emails originating  from Bravura Security Fabric  and the Functional.hid_email_notific ation
component will be subject to these rules.
1.Click Manage external data store  > hid_global_c on figur ation  to add the new rules. 1.
2.Add new rules with the following values:2.
▪namespace:  hid_email_notific ation ▪
▪ setting:  BLOCK_EMAIL ▪
▪key:  ADDRESS for individual address, REGEX for regular expression pattern ▪
▪value:  Email address or regular expression pattern. ▪
▪Each value can only contain a single address or pattern,  however, multiple  settings/k e y s  can be ▪
de fined.Addresses and regular expression patterns  can also be de fined  in python scripts that become part of a
custom component. For example:
from idmlib.idmemail import Email
e = Email()
e.se t_subject("T esting  sending raw Email object")
e.attach_t e x t("This  is a Test Email.")
e.set_to(addresses)
e.set_from('s@scratch.local')
e.send_smtp(
excluded_emails={'blocked_address@test.local'},
e x clude_r eg e x es={r'notific ation_.*'},
)
See Cr eating  custom components  (on page 319) for more in f ormation  about custom components.
Con figur ation  via the wfemail component
The component framework provides a way to manage what emails are sent by Bravura Security Fabric  to
notif y  and remind users and authorizers of w orkflo w  events, including the following:
▪Authorizer approvals, denials, and esc alations ▪
▪ Deleg ation  requests ▪
▪Batch processing events▪
The Functional.hid_policy_w f email  component controls policy settings  for all of the available w orkflo w
events in Bravura Security Fabric .
This component provides a policy table that allows granular control over the behavior of individual
events within Bravura Security Fabric . Each event can be c on figur ed  to send messages to end users via
either email or push notific ation.  Each event can also be c on figur ed  to write sent emails to a file. In
addition,  the policy table allows any w orkflo w  event notific ation  to have its original subject and body
o v er written,  which permits an administrator to provide their own f ormatting ,  structure and logic to
Bravura Security Fabric .
Installing Functional.hid_policy_w f email  will aut omatic ally  set GLOBAL_MAIL_PLUGIN to wfemail.py .
See COMPONENTS  (on page 312) for more in f ormation  about installing components.
In order to complete email c on figur ation,  you must:
1. Con figur e  w orkflo w  options  in Manage the system > W orkflo w  > Options  > Email c on figur ation , 1.
including the email server and sender address.
2.Verify that the hid_policy_wfemail table in the external data store (extdb) is c on figur ed  for your 2.
environment.3. Con figur e  events to send messages to users via email or push notific ation. 3.
Example: Sending email when a user is locked out
This example shows you how to c on figur e  Bravura Security Fabric  to send an email to an administrator
when a user is locked out due to too many failed login attemp ts.
Requirements
This use case assumes that:
▪Bravura Security Fabric  and Connector Pack are installed. ▪
▪An Activ e  Directory system has been targeted as a source of pr ofiles. ▪
▪All users have values de fined  in the mail attribut e  on the Activ e  Directory target system. ▪
Configur e  email settings
To c on figur e  email settings:
1.Log in to Bravura Security Fabric  as superuser . 1.2.Click Manage the system > W orkflo w  >  Email c on figur ation . 2.
When you select the W orkflo w  tab, Bravura Security Fabric directs you to the Email c onfiguration
menu until  the required variables are set.
3.Note the following settings  which are set during ins t allation: 3.
▪BASE IDSYNCH URL  The URL that will display in all emails to direct users to the Bravura Security ▪
Fabric  applic ation.
▪GLOBAL MAIL PLUGIN  The plugin that sends email to users. ▪
The default setting ,  global-mail-plugin , is o v er written  by the hid_policy_wfemail
component to use the plugin_wfemail.py  plugin.
▪GLOBAL MAIL PLUGINDIR  The directory path to store messages when they are written  to a file. ▪
The default is <Program Files path>\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\Logs\<instance> mail.
4.Set the following:4.
▪MAIL SEND METHOD  SMTP,FILE ▪
These are the delivery options  for notific ation  messages. When the MAIL SEND METHOD  value
includes FILE,  it writes to a file in the directory specified  by GLOBAL MAIL PLUGIN MAILDIR ,
which by default is <Program Files path>\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\Logs
\<instance>mail. When the value includes SMTP , the plugin sends emails.
▪MAIL_SERVER  <mail server address> This can be localhost . ▪
▪RECIPIENT_EMAIL  The comma-delimited list email addresses of the Bravura Security Fabric ▪
administrators who should receive notific ation  of events r elating  to the running of the server; for
example admin@example.corp .
▪SENDER_EMAIL  The email address that will appear as the sender of emails; for example ▪
bravura@example.corp .
When accessing the product using the Google Chrome browser, Google Password Manager can
erroneously aut o-fill  the MAIL AUTH LOGIN and MAIL AUTH PASSWORD fields  from saved
credentials.  These fields  do not require values for this course and, if filled,  will cause emails to fail.
Clear these fields  and disable Google Password Manager as follows: 1. Click your Google Chrome
profile  avatar at top right. 2. Click the Passwords  (key) icon under your name/email address. Toggle
the Off er  to save passwords  switch to Off .
