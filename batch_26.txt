Enabling logging
You can use the logutil program to enable logging, for debugging purposes, for add-on softw ar e.  To
do so:
1.Copy the logutil program, located in the util directory on the Bravura Security Fabric  server, to 1.
the server hosting  the add-on tools. It can be placed anywhere on the server.
2.Open a command prompt and invoke logutil  with: 2.
logutil -makekey -instance <instance> -level <loglevel> 
The -makekey option  needs to be run once only, to generate an instance name and required registry
entries.
See logutil  usage
Requirements
You must run the logutil  command as an administrator with sufficien t  privileges.
Usage
logutil.e x e  [options]  -instance <instance> | -cleanup [-instance <instance> ]Argument Description
-bufmax <count> Maximum number of buff er s.  The default value is the
Windows Events MinimumBuff er s  + 20.
-bufmin <count> Minimum number of buff er s.  The default value is the
number of CPUs + 2.
-bufsize <size> Size of the session buff er s  in multiples  of 4 kb. The
default is 64 kb.
-instance <instance> Instance to watch events for. For Bravura Privilege local
service mode instances, the value is "Privileged Access
Manager Client".
-cleanup Terminate any logging sessions which are not connected
to any activ e  client. If the instance name is specified,  only
the logging session for this particular  instance is cleaned
up.
-level <level> Debug level 1-5. Default is 5.
-list List all enabled Event Tracing for Windows sessions.
-logfile  <filename> File to write events to. You must specify an absolute path.
-makekey Generate an instance name and its log GUID in the
registry.
Note:  This option  needs to be run once only.
-maxdelay <maxdelay> The maximum seconds to allow the sorting  buff er  to keep
items before flushing  out into the log file. The default
value is 300.
-maxsorted <count> The maximum number of events that can be sorted in
memory. The default value is 100,000.
-outdbg Write events with an output debug string.
When logutil  runs, a new registry entry is created to record the session. The entry is stored under:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\<instance>\LogSession
The name of the entry is the instance name. When you press [enter]  to stop a session, the key will be
gone with the session; however, if you kill the session by typing [Ctrl] +[C], the registry entry will remain.
Use the -cleanup option  to remove remaining registry entries.
Note that various tools also have hardcoded instance names:
▪browser-extension-win: "Browser Extension" ▪
▪ fir e f o x -br o w ser -e xt ension:  "Firefox Browser Extension" ▪

in f ormation.7 Managing proxy servers
In some cases, the c onnection  to a target system may be slow, insecure or blocked by a fir e w all.  This is
often  true when the c onnection  is made over a wide area network.
To address such c onnectivity  problems, Bravura Security Fabric  includes an applic ation  proxy server.
When a proxy server is deployed, the main Bravura Security Fabric  server ceases to communicate with
one or more (usually distant) target systems directly, and instead forwards all c ommunic ation  to those
systems through one or more co-located proxy servers.
Communic ation  from the main Bravura Security Fabric  server to the proxy servers is encrypted, e fficien t,
and tolerant of high latency.
When fir e w alls  intervene, the TCP port number of the proxy is programmable, a port redirector can be
used, and only a single opening through the fir e w all  is required for multiple  target systems.
Communic ation  between the proxy server and target systems c ontinues  to use nativ e  protocols, but it is
physically controlled, in a high-bandwidth, low-latency, high-security LAN.  
This chapter shows you how to:
1.Install a proxy server  (on page 260). 1.
2. Con figur e  target systems to point to the proxy  (on page 265). 2.
3.Update the proxy server  with updated c on figur ation  from the Bravura Security Fabric  server, if 3.
required.

server to execute account management connectors on behalf of the Bravura Security Fabric  server.
