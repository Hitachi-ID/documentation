▪To detect and update changes in attribut es  associated to user accounts such as names, passwords, ▪
phone number, office  and home address, work status (activ e  or inactiv e  due to leave of absence),
manager, team/group/department, and contact in f ormation.
The detected changes are updated on scheduled intervals. Authorized users can also run the update
program manually in Manage the system  or on the command line.
Initial  c onsider ations
Where are the changes coming from?
▪Account attribut es  changes (set by default) ▪
▪Group membership changes, (parent/child group)▪
▪Persistent listing  setting:  enable or not enable (set to not enable by default) ▪
▪The target system such as user accounts being added and deleted, accounts joining or leaving▪
managed groups (group membership), changes in account association  (user transfer)
▪ Addition  or deletion  of target system ▪
How do you want to update the changes in the database?
▪Use scheduled intervals for auto discovery to detect the changes and load them into database▪
▪Manually run auto discovery when required▪
▪A c ombination  of scheduled and manual processes ▪
Best pr actice Run auto discovery when there are changes in the target system or the
selected options  in the Target system inf ormation  page.

De t ecting  changes in AD target system using the "Track account changes" option
This example shows how to c on figur e  Bravura Identity  to detect changes to accounts on an Activ e
Directory target system that have been made out-of-band from Bravura Security Fabric . Changes that will
be tracked include:
▪Accounts added and deleted▪
▪Accounts joining or leaving▪
▪Managed groups▪
▪Account attribut e  values being changed ▪
▪Account association  being changed ▪
The tracked changes are viewable in reports as part of each user’s pr ofile  history. This can also be used in
automated user adminis tr ation.
Requirements
This example assumes that:▪Bravura Security Fabric  and Connector Pack  installed. ▪
▪An Activ e  Directory target system is added as a source of pr ofiles. ▪
To use the target system option:
1.Log in to the front-end as superuser.1.
2.Click Manage the System > Resources > Target systems  > Manually de fined . 2.
3.Select the Activ e  Directory target system. 3.
4.Ensure that the Track account changes  box is selected. 4.
5.Click Update  to save the change. 5.
6.Run auto discovery6.
By default, Bravura Security Fabric  runs auto discovery  every night at 1:30 am. Bravura Security Fabric
aut omatic ally  schedules  (on page 2702) this "psupdate" job when you add your fir s t target system.
To manually start auto discovery , from the Manage the system  (PSA) module, click Manage the system >
Maintenance >  Auto discovery > Execute auto discovery , then click Continue . Bravura Security Fabric
displays the Auto discovery  status page that indicates whether auto discovery  is running. Click Refresh
to update the page.
Each time  it is run, auto discovery  attemp ts  to verify that it is not already running on another server.
Never run psupdate  on more than one replicated Bravura Security Fabric server at the same time.
To run specific  tasks during auto discovery :
1.Clear the All checkbox for Selected target systems . 1.
2.Type, or search for, the IDs of the target systems you want to include.2.
3.Select the tasks you want to include:3.
Task Equivalent command
List data from specified  target
systems.psupdate.exe -target <target ID> -list
Load data from specified  target
systems into the databasepsupdate.exe -target <target ID> -
loaddb
You can also run auto discovery  for specific  targets on the target system in f ormation  page  (on page 489)
or by na vig ating  to Manage the system > Resources > Target systems > <type> , selecting  targets and
clicking Run discovery .
Alt ernativ ely ,  you can start auto discovery  from the command line by running the psupdate  program.
 
See psupdate
The psupdate program initia t es  and controls the auto discovery process. It is responsible for calling
a series of programs and PSLang scripts, which in turn, control e x ecution  of each auto discovery task.
These tasks include:▪Refreshing proxy servers▪
▪ Listing  in f ormation  from managed systems ▪
▪Evaluate the import rules on discovered systems and accounts and assign them to managed system▪
policies
▪Monitoring list file size ▪
▪ Con figuring  listed computer objects as Bravura Privilege resources ▪
▪ Updating  the Bravura Security Fabric database ▪
▪ De t ecting  out-of-band changes ▪
▪Cleaning up the database▪
▪Checking inventory levels▪
▪Loading user class cache▪
▪ Submitting  aut omatic  assignment requests ▪
▪Synchronize server files and registry keys ▪
▪ Notif ying  the Bravura Security Fabric administrator of errors or warnings ▪
▪ Cr eating  the default scheduled task to run psupdate ▪
You can also run psupdate to update a single user.
Never run psupdate on more than one replicated Bravura Security Fabric server at the same time
In a replic ation  environment, the sending node creates additional  queue files in the <ins t anc e>/db/
replic ation  directory. These are used to store the data to be sent to all replic ation  nodes. Once this
data has been replicated to the nodes, these files are removed.
