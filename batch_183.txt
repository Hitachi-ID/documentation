Custom attribut e  file
You can use custom system attribut es  to de fine  requirements for import rules. For local service mode
systems, computer in f ormation  is not stored on the Bravura Privilege  server, but locally on the system
itself.
The local service installer can read a custom attribut e  file and send in f ormation  back to the server to be
used by import rules as discovered system attribut es.  The custom attribut e  file must be in KVGroup
format:
# KVGROUP-V2.0 
"custom_attribute" "" = { 
  "<attribute1>" = "value1"; 
  "<attribute2>" = "value2"; 
  ... 
  "<multi-valued attribute1>" "" = { 
     "<mv1-value1>"; 
     "<mv1-value2>"; 
     ... 
  "<multi-valued attribute2>" "" = { 
     "<mv2-value1>"; 
     .... 
  }; 
}; 
For example:
 
# KVGROUP-V2.0 
"custom_attribute" "" = { 
  "location" = "calgary"; 
  "system_type" = "laptop"; 
 
  "departments" "" = { 
     "sales"; 
     "marketing"; 
  }; 
}; 
There are some res trictions  on what names the custom attribut es  may use. If any of the custom attribut es
are using these values, they will invalidate the attribut e  file and any new attribut es  will not be sent to the
Bravura Privilege server. The attribut e  names such as NETBIOS, dNSHostName and f ailedAttemp ts  are
some examples.
Custom discovered system object attribut es  can be removed by setting  the cust-attr-file registry
entry of the local service of the w ork s t ation  to an empty string.Custom discovered system object attribut es  can be added by setting  the cust-attr-file registry
entry of the local service of the w ork s t ation  to the full path name of the custom attribut e  file.
In t egr ating  with McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO)
The Local W ork s t ation  Service can send pr operties  of its ins t allation  to the McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator
(ePO) via McAfee Agent. These pr operties  include the product version, the ins t allation  path, and
language version.
The server or w ork s t ation  on which the Local W ork s t ation  Service will be installed must be added as a
system on the ePO. Consult the McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator documen t ation  to learn how to do this.

Adding vault-only managed systems
In vault-only mode, Bravura Privilege  simply stores in f ormation  about a managed system. In this case,
there is no c ommunic ation  between the Bravura Privilege  server and the managed system; all
in f ormation  is inputted  and maintained by product administrator  s. Bravura Privilege  does not
aut omatic ally  randomize passwords for these managed systems. Vault-only managed system  can only
belong to vault-only type managed system policies .
You can apply access controls to allow certain users to change a stored password after  they have it
checked out. To do this, grant users in a user group the Randomize/Override permission to the vault-only
managed system policy. See Assigning access controls  (on page 1861) to learn how to apply system policy
access controls.
Product administrators require the "Create managed systems"  adminis tr ativ e  privilege in order to add a
vault-only managed system.
To add a vault-only managed system:
1.Click Manage the system  > Privileged access  > Managed systems . 1.
2.Click Add new… 2.3.Type an ID and Description  that will be displayed to users. 3.
4. Optional:  Type a Help URL. 4.
In case a longer description  would help users, you can compose and post an HTML page that describes
this system further, and type its URL here. Users can open the URL by clicking the managed system
description  text wherever the text appears as a link in the Request privileged access  (PSW) module.
5.Click Add. 5.
To learn how to add accounts and passwords for vault-only systems, see Storing adminis tr ativ e  passwords
manually  (on page 1873).
Viewing and modifying managed system in f ormation
You can view managed system  details on the Managed system in f ormation  page. Depending on how the
managed system  is c on figur ed,  you may be able to modify some managed system  in f ormation.
Only product administrator s with the Manage orphan managed systems right can modify managed
systems that are not assigned to a managed system policy .
To view or modify managed system in f ormation:
1.Click Manage the system  > Privileged access  > Managed systems . 1.
Bravura Privilege  displays a list of managed managed systems.The managed system  page details the managed system ’s type (local service, push, or vault-only), the
target system’s type, and the number of managed system policies it belongs to. You can view if
account passwords for managed systems can be randomized in the Randomiz ation  tab.
2.Select the managed system  you want to view or modify. 2.

Deleting  a managed system
Deleted managed systems are removed from all managed systems policies and are not placed in the
HISTORICAL_DATA_GRP policy. Their passwords are no longer accessible through the GUI, but are still
accessible by using KMKeyGetByAccount  and RecoverKeyByAccount API functions.Ensure that you note the password for each managed system before removing the managed system.
Deleted managed systems are not placed in the HISTORICAL_DATA_GRP policy.
You cannot delete any managed system  that has checked-out passwords.
To remove a managed system :

To re-manage a push mode deleted system, the aut omatic ally  discovered object corresponding to the
managed system also needs to be deleted by Removing managed systems from the target system menu
(on page 1830).
Removing managed systems from managed system policies
A managed system can also be removed or unbound from a managed system policy. In this case, if the
managed system does not belong to any policy, it will be moved into the HISTORICAL_DATA_GRP policy
where its passwords are stored. In this state, the passwords are still accessible, but no longer
randomized.
To unbind a managed system from a managed system policy:
1.Click Manage the system  > Privileged access  > Managed system policies . 1.
