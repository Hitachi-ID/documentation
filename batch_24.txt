5 Installing Bravura Security Fabric  from the command line
setup
Use the setup program, located at the root of the dis tribution  folder, to:
▪Modify (add or remove) features for an instance▪
▪Repair an instance▪
▪Upgrade an instance▪
▪Uninstall an instance▪
▪Install a new instance▪
You can only upgrade the software  if your Bravura Security Fabric release supports those actions.
The setup program gathers initial  c on figur ation  in f ormation  then launches the Bravura Security Fabric
installer package file (idm.msi  by default).  
Requirements
The setup program requires Windows Installer version 3.0.1 or later. This program should be run by a
member of the Windows Administrators group.
The setup program calculates required disk space before ins t allation,  and will prompt the
administrator if more is needed. However, additional  space may be required for backups when modifying
or upgrading an e xisting  ins t allation.  If the system runs out of disk space during ins t allation  or backup,
you will be prompted to make more space available before c ontinuing.
Backing up files is not supported when upgrading from versions earlier than 10.0.1.
Usage
Use the Windows command prompt to run setup with additional  arguments, listed below.
setup.exe [arguments]

This chapter describes Bravura Security  add-on softw ar e  that can be installed on external servers or client
w ork s t ations.  Files for add-on softw ar e  are loaded onto the Bravura Security Fabric  server, in the addon
directory, when you install the core softw ar e.
In some cases the softw ar e  is installed using an MSI installer. This chapter also provides general
ins tructions  for using the installers manually, or by setting  a global policy for unattended  ins t allation.
All of Bravura Security ’s *.exe, *.ocx, *.dll, and *.msi files are digitally signed.
About add-on softw ar e
The following add-on softw ar e  is distributed with Bravura Security Fabric :
▪Transparent password s ynchr oniz ation  trigger softw ar e ▪
▪Domain-level secure kiosk account softw ar e  (on page 241) ▪
▪Local secure kiosk account softw ar e  (on page 241) ▪
▪Security Fabric local reset extension  (on page 241) ▪
▪ Notific ation  client  (on page 242) ▪
▪Lotus Notes Extension client tools  (on page 242) ▪
▪Local w ork s t ation  service  (on page 242) ▪

Transparent password s ynchr oniz ation  trigger softw ar e
When you implement transparent s ynchr oniz ation , you install special softw ar e  on the trigger system to
monitor password changes and test the strength of new password choices. This softw ar e  communicates
with the Password Manager service on the Bravura Pass  server, using an encrypted TCP socket
c onnection.
Softw ar e  for the following triggers are shipped with Bravura Security Fabric :
▪Password Change Notific ation  Module The psintcpt program intercepts nativ e  password changes ▪
on Micr osoft  Activ e  Directory domain controllers and Windows servers, and triggers transparent
password s ynchr oniz ation.
You install this softw ar e  using the intcpt.msi  or intcpt-x64.msi  (on page 249) installer.
▪LDAP password filt er  plugin ( psldap ) The psldap  program intercepts nativ e  password changes on ▪
LDAP Directory Service servers and triggers transparent password s ynchr oniz ation.
Softw ar e  for Windows-based LDAP servers is stored on the Bravura Security Fabric  server when you
install Bravura Security Fabric . You copy it and c on figur e  it on the LDAP server.
Softw ar e  for Unix-based LDAP servers is stored on the Bravura Security Fabric  server when you install
Connector Pack . You copy it and c on figur e  it on the LDAP server.
