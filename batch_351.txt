For conciseness, unless otherwise noted, the following procedures assume that your current working
directory is the \<instance>\design\ directory.
Unless otherwise instructed, do not change any code that begins and ends in percent (%) signs. These
codes are replaced by session-specific  text when Bravura Security Fabric builds each page.
Add background image to login sequence
You can add a custom background image to the Front-end (PSF) that will display behind the login
sequence.
For example:
1.Open <instance>/design/custom/_common-custom.scss1.
2.Add the following:2.
$auth-use-image: true;
$auth-bg: '<filename of image>';
3.Add the background image into the <instance>/design/src/ui/src/assets/images 3.
directory
4.Generate the new skins4.
To generate and install new or modified  skin files,  use the following format for the commands to run
from the <instance>\design\ directory, where en-us  is American English:
1.Compile the skins:1.make.bat default en-us
Changes are saved in the instance's <instance>\design\skin\ directory
2.Install the skins:2.
make.bat install default en-us
The compiled files are copied to the instance's skin\ directory
3.If necessary, reload and review any changes to Bravura Security Fabric  web pages. 3.
Do not run the second command to install the skins if they fail to compile, especially if the firs t m4
file (links.m4) fails to compile.
Skins can fail to compile if something in the environment is locking the skin files.  That can be a
malware program, an automated backup tool running at the time,  but more likely the product UI itself
being in use at the time  of the skin c ompilation
Have a test instance where you can compile the skins when the instance is not being used. Make a
backup copy of the files on the production  instance in case you need to quickly roll them back. Review
changes on the test instance, then copy the skin files to the production  instance.
Steps to disable the image:
To disable the image:
1.Open <instance>/design/custom/_common-custom.scss1.
2.Set $auth-use-image: to false2.
$auth-use-image: false;
3.Generate the new skins3.
To generate and install new or modified  skin files,  use the following format for the commands to run

The files stored in the ‘ui/src/assets/images’ are removed during upgrade causing the pos t -ins t allation
task ‘build skin’ to fail because the image file cannot be found. The workaround is to copy the image
back to the ‘ui/src/assets/images’ directory after  upgrade and rebuild skin
Use custom input fields
You can add custom fields  to form-input tags. These fields  are used to capture additional  session
in f ormation  from the GUI. The in f ormation  can then be used by interface programs and external systems
for auditing  and internal purposes.
Bravura Security Fabric  provides four custom fields,  CUSTOM[1-4]. Each field  is associated with an
OPC[1-4] event in Bravura Security Fabric . When a user submits a form that includes a custom field,  the
corresponding event code is written  to the session log and the value of the custom field  is stored as the
event result. The custom field  and its value are also passed to any listening exit traps.
To implement custom fields  that are accessible to the web-modules, follow the procedure described in
Change the layout  (on page 3496), and add the fields  to the form-input tag in the appropriate m4 file.
Examples
The following example is the general format for using custom fields  in form-input tags:
 <form name="theform" method="post" action="%PR OGRAM%"  aut oc omple t e="off">
   <INPUT type="hidden" name="CUSTOM1" value="value1">
   <INPUT type="hidden" name="CUSTOM2" value="value2">
   <INPUT type="hidden" name="CUSTOM3" value="value3">
   <INPUT type="hidden" name="CUSTOM4" value="value4">
 </form>A pr actic al  applic ation  of this feature is to prompt the user to enter additional  in f ormation  that may be
needed for company purposes. For example, if a user were to lock themselves out of Bravura Security
Fabric , they can be prompted to enter their phone number to receive a call back from the help desk. In
this case, you can modify the m4 files to include the following:
Please enter your phone number:
<input type="text" name="CUSTOM1">
You can c on figur e  an interface program to dump the session in f ormation  to a tick e t,  which can be used
by the help desk to conduct an appropriate follow up for the locked out user.
Modify the pr ofile  ID prompt
When the PROFILE ID TAG option  is enabled ( Manage the system  > Modules  > Front-end  (psf) ), users
enter their pr ofile  ID as the login ID, instead of, or as an additional  option  to selecting  a target system on
which to identif y  themselves. For example:
You can use text other than Bravura Security Fabric  by changing the value of PROFILE_ID_TAG .
For example, to change the tag to your company name:
1.Create the file: \<instance>\design\custom\en-us-language.kvg 1.
Edit the file to replace the _SUITE string with your company name; for example:
# KVGROUP-V1.0 
"language" "EN_US" = { 
  "PROFILE_ID_TAG" "" = { 
     "text" = "Example Company"   } 
}
2.Open a command prompt and go to \<instance>\design\.2.
Run the following two commands:
make.bat default en-us 
make.bat install default en-us
3.Test the result by opening a browser to the Front-end (psf) login page.3.
You can also customize and in t ernationaliz e  the product name by modifying the _SUITE tag.
Add to the authentic ation  menu
You can add authentic ation  methods to the Front-end (PSF) and customize the design of the
authentic ation  menu. To do this:
1. Con figur e  and enable the authentic ation  method using the Manage the system  (PSA) module.. 1.
2.Review the procedures in Changing the layout  (on page 3496) and Altering text by editing  KVG files 2.
(on page 3489) to learn how to edit the m4 and KVGroup files.
3.Modify the design of the authentic ation  menu by cr eating  psf.m4  in the custom\ directory with the 3.
following tag:
!!!F_AUTH_<plugin name> 
<tr> 
  TABLE_TDB 
    _<PLUGIN DESCRIPTION TAG> 
  TABLE_TDE 
  TABLE_TDB 
    <input type="image" alt="_<PLUGIN BUTTON TAG>" title="_<PLUGIN BUTTON TAG>" name="<plugin name>" src="_PICSDIR/
select.png" style="height: 15px; width: 16px;" class="image" /> 
  TABLE_TDE 
</tr>
To avoid typing the above text, you can copy any of the e xisting  !!!F_AUTH_<plugin name>  tags
from the source psf.m4 file to the custom file. Modify the custom file accordingly.
4.Add text for the authentic ation  method by cr eating  en-us-language.kvg  in the custom\ 4.
directory with the following inner KVGroups:
  "_<PLUGIN DESCRIPTION TAG>" "" = { 
    "text" = "<text to prompt the user with>" 
  } 
  "_<PLUGIN BUTTON TAG>" "" = { 
    "text" = "<alternate text for the select button>" 
  }
5.Save and close the custom files. 5.
6.Generate and install the new skin files 6.To generate and install new or modified  skin files,  use the following format for the commands to run
from the <instance>\design\ directory, where en-us  is American English:
1.Compile the skins:1.
make.bat default en-us
Changes are saved in the instance's <instance>\design\skin\ directory
2.Install the skins:2.
make.bat install default en-us
The compiled files are copied to the instance's skin\ directory
3.If necessary, reload and review any changes to Bravura Security Fabric  web pages. 3.
Do not run the second command to install the skins if they fail to compile, especially if the firs t m4
file (links.m4) fails to compile.
Skins can fail to compile if something in the environment is locking the skin files.  That can be a
malware program, an automated backup tool running at the time,  but more likely the product UI itself
being in use at the time  of the skin c ompilation
Have a test instance where you can compile the skins when the instance is not being used. Make a
backup copy of the files on the production  instance in case you need to quickly roll them back. Review
changes on the test instance, then copy the skin files to the production  instance.
.
To modify the text for other languages that you have installed, follow the above procedure but replace
en-us  in the filename  and EN_US  in the outer KVGroup with the appropriate language code.
Example: Add a custom authentic ation  method
To add the custom authentic ation  method valifake.exe to the authentic ation  menu:
▪Create your custom psf.m4  file like this: ▪
!!!F_AUTH_valifake.exe 
<tr> 
  TABLE_TDB 
    _VALIFAKE_DESC 
  TABLE_TDE 
  TABLE_TDB 
    <input type="image" alt="_BUTTON_VALIFAKE" title="_BUTTON_VALIFAKE" name="valifake.exe" src="_PICSDIR/
select.png" style="height: 15px; width: 16px;" class="image" /> 
  TABLE_TDE 
</tr>
▪Create your custom en-us-language.kv g file like this: ▪
# KVGROUP-V1.0 
"language" "EN_US" = { 
  "_VALIFAKE_DESC" "" = {     "text" = "Use valifake to enter today's secret phrase" 
  } 
  "_BUTTON_VALIFAKE" "" = { 
    "text" = "Use valifake.exe" 
  } 
}

Write a customized authentic ation  plugin  (on page 1032).
Add custom links to the Front-end (PSF)
You can add custom links in the Front-end (PSF) that will open product pages or external sites in a new
tab.
The format for the link is:
<UNIQUE_ID>|<custom/site/path>|<custom link description>|<USER CLASS_ID>|<ADMINA CL>|
<TYPE>
You can add multiple  links to a menu group by adding multiple  entries separated by a semicolon.
A link is displayed on the Front-end (PSF) if the user is a member of the specified  user class, or has the
specified  access control. The user class ID must be a single-participan t  class. The user class and ACL
values can be empty.
The TYPE must be either:
▪EXTERNAL linking to a site outside of Bravura Security Fabric ▪
▪ABSOLUTE linking to an absolute path within Bravura Security Fabric ▪
For example:
1.Review the procedures in Change the layout  (on page 3496) and Alter text by editing  KVG files (on 1.
page 3489) to learn how to edit the m4 files.
2.Add a psf.m4  file in \<instance>\design\custom\, if one does not exist already. 2.
3.Edit the file to include: 3.
 !!!F_CUSTOM_LINK_MYPROFILE_GROUP 
 HIDSITE|https://bravurasecurity.com|Bravura Security Website|
_ALLUSERS_|maintain|EXTERNAL; 
 UACC|manage-reports/reports/r~REPORT_CATEGORY_USERS|User accounts|
_REPORT_READERS_|REPORT_READERS|ABSOLUTE
4.Generate and install the new skin files 4.
To generate and install new or modified  skin files,  use the following format for the commands to run
from the <instance>\design\ directory, where en-us  is American English:
1.Compile the skins:1.make.bat default en-us
Changes are saved in the instance's <instance>\design\skin\ directory
2.Install the skins:2.
make.bat install default en-us
The compiled files are copied to the instance's skin\ directory
3.If necessary, reload and review any changes to Bravura Security Fabric  web pages. 3.
Do not run the second command to install the skins if they fail to compile, especially if the firs t m4
file (links.m4) fails to compile.
Skins can fail to compile if something in the environment is locking the skin files.  That can be a
malware program, an automated backup tool running at the time,  but more likely the product UI itself

backup copy of the files on the production  instance in case you need to quickly roll them back. Review
changes on the test instance, then copy the skin files to the production  instance.
.
The entries in the example above add a link to the Bravura Security website and a product report link to
the My pr ofile  menu group.
Modify the display of embedded links
You can modify the appearance of embedded links by editing:
▪common.m4 tags  (on page 3510) ▪
▪component templates  (on page 3511) ▪
Modify embedded links through common.m4
You can modify the appearance of specific  embedded links throughout the product.
For example, to modify how managed system embedded links are displayed:
1.Go to \<instance>\design\src\common.1.
2.Open common.m4 . 2.
3.Modify the text  argument for C_DISPLAY_MANAGED_SYSTEM. 3.
4.Generate the skin files;  for example: 4.
make.bat default en-us 
make.bat install default en-us
For example, to modify how e xisting  and newly-created managed group in f ormation  embedded links are
displayed:
1.Go to \<instance>\design\src\common.1.
2.Open common.m4 . 2.
