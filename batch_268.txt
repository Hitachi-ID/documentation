Con figuring  template-level resource oper ations
You can de fine  resource oper ations  for inventory templates to:
▪Determine whether Bravura Security Fabric  agents aut omatic ally  fulfill  requests or whether human ▪
agents will carry out tasks to fulfill  the requests.
▪Add implementers to a template to de fine  who fulfills  requests based on the template if an Bravura ▪
Security Fabric  connector is not used.
You can override resource oper ations  at the target system and template level. If the oper ation  is set at
either of those levels to be carried out by an implementer, you must assign at least one implementer. If
you do not do this, requests involving the template will be put on hold unless implementers are
dynamically assigned by a plugin. See Determining implementers  (on page 2402) for details.
Inheriting  resource oper ation  c on figur ation  from the target system
You can c on figur e  target systems so that templates inherit the resource oper ation  c on figur ation  settings
of the target system. You can also override the c on figur ation  for a template, or add implementers.
Enable inheritance by selecting  the Default authoriz ation  for child resources,including templates and
managed groups, will be inherited from the target system option  on the relevant Target system
in f ormation  page  (on page 494).
To override or add to the c on figur ation  for a template:
1.Navigate to the Inventory template inf ormation  page 1.
Use the Inventory template inf ormation  page to c on figur e  general inventory template in f ormation  and
to access additional  c on figur ation  settings.  To navigate to this page:

4.Click Update . 4.Assigning s t atic  implementers
When the template-level oper ation  is carried out by an implementer, whether by inheriting  the setting
from the target system, or being explicitly set, an Implementers  table is included on the Implementer
oper ation  page. If implementers are assigned to the target system, they are inherited by the template.
You can remove or keep the inherited implementer, or add new implementers for the template.
If you chose to not inherit the c onfiguration  from the target system, you cannot assign the same
implementer that is assigned at the target system level.

Deleting  templates
When you delete a template in the Manage the system  (PSA) module, it is flag g ed  as disabled in the
Bravura Security Fabric  database. It is maintained for audit purposes.
Once a template is flag g ed  as disabled in the Bravura Security Fabric  database, you can delete objects
associated with the template; for example, authorizers, target systems.
Con figuring  resource attribut es
It is possible to add resource attribut es  to this resource type; you can use resource attribut es  to create
and set attribut e  values for individual resources. Before you can do this, you must add the resource
attribut es  to at least one resource attribut e  group, and c on figur e  access to resource attribut es.Inventory Objects and States
Bravura Identity  manages inventory by:
▪Maintaining a list of inventory items – This list can be used for provisioning or internal purposes. It ▪
includes the identif ying  in f ormation,  loc ation,  type, and state of each item.
One way to create the initial  inventory list, or to keep it up-to-date, is to assign inventory managers
and have them do the work using the Bravura Security Fabric  web interface.
▪Provisioning inventory items to users – In general, Bravura Identity facilitates the provisioning of items ▪
by allowing users to submit requests for new items, r outing  request to authorizers for approval (if
applicable), and notif ying  the appropriate people when items need to be delivered, shipped, or
recovered.
The process for r equesting  an inventory item is similar to the process for r equesting  a new account.
For example, to request a new wireless device, users select an inventory template named smartphone
to which the individual devices are mapped.
Bravura Identity  keeps track of inventory items by altering their state in f ormation  (available, reserved,
assigned). Inventory managers and product administrator  s can also manually change the state of an item.
The list of possible inventory states is pr e-de fined  in Bravura Identity . Some states must be enabled
before they can be used.
The list of inventory items includes the identif ying  in f ormation,  loc ation,  type, and state of each item.
You can load an e xisting  inventory list into Bravura Identity , or update an e xisting  list, using the
manageinv  program to import inventory in batches. See manageinv usage in f ormation
Use the manageinv program to add, remove, and update inventory items.
manageinv may be used to import assigned and unassigned inventory items from RSA Authentic ation
Manager 7.1/8.2 and Vasco IDENTIKEY Server target systems.
Usage
manageinv [-nooverwrite] -add -id <itemID> -type <type> -
location <location> [-user <userID>] [-notes "<notes>"] [-
target <target>] [-state <state>] [-desc "<description>"]
manageinv -rm -id <itemID> -type <type>
manageinv -rm [-type <type>] | [-location <location>] | [-
user <userID>] | [-target <target ID>]
manageinv -add|-rm [<arguments>] -f <filename>
manageinv -add|-rm -target <target> -type <type> -
location <location> [-state <state>] -listfile <filename>
Commands are de fined  using the following arguments:Argument Description
-add Adds inventory items to the database, or updates e xisting
entries.
-rm Removes inventory items from the database.
-nooverwrite Checks if the item being added to the inventory already
exists or not. If the item already exists then the record is
not updated.
-id <ItemID> The item ID in Bravura Identity .
-type <type> The type as de fined  in Bravura Identity . The <type> must
be entered in uppercase; for example, -type TOKEN.
-loc <loc ation> The loc ation  as de fined  in Bravura Identity .
-user <userID> The ID of the user assigned to the item.
-notes <notes> In f ormation  to be read by Bravura Identity  users. Must be
enclosed in double quotes.
-desc <description> Optional  description  of the item.
-state <state> The state of the item (see list of available states below).
-target <target ID> Bravura Security Fabric  target system the item belongs
to. The <target ID> must be entered in upper case; for
example, -target RSAAM.
-f <t e xtfile> Uses a file listing  inventory items to be acted upon. See
Adding multiple  items.
-listfile  <t e xtfile> Uses a list file from an inventory type target system for
items assigned to users or from a listing  file generated by
listunassigned for unassigned items. See Adding multiple
items.
Adding a single item
To add a single item, the item’s ID, type, and loc ation  are required. For example:
manageinv -add -id 0000000111 -type TOKEN -loc NY
Optional  arguments include:
   [-state <state> | -desc <description> | -notes ‘‘<notes>'' | -user
   <user> |  -target <target>]
Adding multiple  items
To add multiple  items, either the -f or -listfile  options  may be specified.   Specifying the -f option:    When
using -f, only this option  is required. For example:
manageinv -add -f items.txt
The text file must be in the format:   itemid type location state description notes user target
Where <state> can be any of:
▪N - Available▪
▪V - In stock▪
▪R - Reserved▪
▪U - Undelivered▪
▪A - Assigned▪
▪O - Outstanding▪
▪P - Approved purchase▪
▪o - Ordered▪
▪D - Permanently damaged▪
▪L - Lost/Stolen▪
▪r - In repair▪
▪d - Disposed▪
▪T - In transit to user▪
▪C - Received by user▪
Use "" for any blank fields.  For example, the following text file row adds an unassigned item:
00000000111 TOKEN CALGARY A "rsa token" "Notes for Calgary token" "" TOKEN1
If you specify any of the values for -type, -loc ation,  -user, -notes, or -target, those values can be skipped
in the text file. For example, if you use the options:
-add  -type TOKEN  -notes "" -f items.txt
then the text file would be in the format:
itemid location user target
Specifying the -listfile  option:   
When using the -listfile  option,  the -target, -type, and -loc options  are also required.
The -listfile  option  uses the <target>.db listing  file from an inventory type target system to add items that
are assigned to users (such as for RSA Authentic ation  Manager 7.1/8.2 or for Vasco IDENTIKEY Server).
For example:
After  setting  up an RSA Authentic ation  Manager 7.1/8.2 target system, run auto discovery. Use the
r esulting  list file to populate the Inventory items list with the assigned tokens:
manageinv -add -target RSAAM -type TOKEN -loc NY -state A -
listfile ..\psconfig\RSAAM.db
The listing  file for unassigned items may also be used to add items from a listing  file generated by
listunassigned  (on page 3611).
