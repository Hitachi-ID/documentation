St arting  auto discovery
By default, Bravura Security Fabric  runs auto discovery  every night at 1:30 am. Bravura Security Fabric
aut omatic ally  schedules  (on page 2702) this "psupdate" job when you add your fir s t target system.
To manually start auto discovery , from the Manage the system  (PSA) module, click Manage the system >
Maintenance >  Auto discovery > Execute auto discovery , then click Continue . Bravura Security Fabricdisplays the Auto discovery  status page that indicates whether auto discovery  is running. Click Refresh to
update the page.
Each time  it is run, auto discovery  attemp ts  to verify that it is not already running on another server.
Never run psupdate  on more than one replicated Bravura Security Fabric server at the same time.
To run specific  tasks during auto discovery :
1.Clear the All checkbox for Selected target systems . 1.
2.Type, or search for, the IDs of the target systems you want to include.2.
3.Select the tasks you want to include:3.
Task Equivalent command
List data from specified  target
systems.psupdate.exe -target <target ID> -list
Load data from specified  target
systems into the databasepsupdate.exe -target <target ID> -
loaddb
You can also run auto discovery  for specific  targets on the target system in f ormation  page  (on page 489) or
by na vig ating  to Manage the system > Resources > Target systems > <type> , selecting  targets and
clicking Run discovery .
Alt ernativ ely ,  you can start auto discovery  from the command line by running the psupdate  program.  
See psupdate
The psupdate program initia t es  and controls the auto discovery process. It is responsible for calling a
series of programs and PSLang scripts, which in turn, control e x ecution  of each auto discovery task.
These tasks include:
▪Refreshing proxy servers▪
▪ Listing  in f ormation  from managed systems ▪
▪Evaluate the import rules on discovered systems and accounts and assign them to managed system▪
policies
▪Monitoring list file size ▪
▪ Con figuring  listed computer objects as Bravura Privilege resources ▪
▪ Updating  the Bravura Security Fabric database ▪
▪ De t ecting  out-of-band changes ▪
▪Cleaning up the database▪
▪Checking inventory levels▪
▪Loading user class cache▪
▪ Submitting  aut omatic  assignment requests ▪
▪Synchronize server files and registry keys ▪
▪ Notif ying  the Bravura Security Fabric administrator of errors or warnings ▪
▪ Cr eating  the default scheduled task to run psupdate ▪You can also run psupdate to update a single user.
Never run psupdate on more than one replicated Bravura Security Fabric server at the same time
In a replic ation  environment, the sending node creates additional  queue files in the <ins t anc e>/db/
replic ation  directory. These are used to store the data to be sent to all replic ation  nodes. Once this data
has been replicated to the nodes, these files are removed.

Viewing the last auto discovery log
You can use the Manage the system  (PSA) module to view the log for the last e x ecution  of auto discovery .
Note: The date and time  recorded in the Bravura Security Fabric  logs are based
on the settings  of Windows server where Bravura Security Fabric  is
installed. You can view the current Bravura Security Fabric  server date and
time  from the Last autodiscovery log page.
To do this:
1.Click Maintenance > Auto discovery > Last log . 1.
Bravura Security Fabric  displays the Last auto discovery log page.
2.If necessary, enter search criteria to display only specified  log entries, listed in the table below. 2.
3.Click Search . 3.
Log message Type a string or a regular expression that represents the log message you want to view.
You can use + and - symbols to include keywords from the search; for example
+ update operation - unlock
includes the keywords update and operation , and excludes unlock .
If you want to use a regular expression, you must also select the corresponding Regular
expression checkbox.
Severity Select if you want to view only messages at a particular  level of severity.
Process Type a string or a regular expression that represents the process you want to view. If you
want to use a regular expression, you must also select the corresponding Regular
expression checkbox.
Da t e/time Use the:
▪First field  to select the earliest log entry to include. ▪
▪Second field  to select the latest log entry to include. ▪Downloading logs
Click Download to save the current log view to a file on the server. Any search criteria filt ering  is
preserved in the file. A copy of the file is saved to the Logs directory and is rotated along with the rest of
the logs.

Using Regular Expressions
Regular expressions provide a way to identif y  patterns  of text in strings.
Bravura Security Fabric  uses regular expressions to:
▪Match and block invalid passwords.▪
▪ Identif y  users who it should not manage. ▪
▪Extract text from Telnet/TN3270 screens in Telnet connector scripts.▪
▪Extract text from the output of password hashing programs in DBMS connector scripts.▪
Regular expressions use a shorthand of literal characters and special characters to de fine  a pattern  in a
precise and compact way. Literal characters are case sensitiv e.  The regular expression parser used by
Bravura Security Fabric  uses the following special characters in literal strings:
Character Purpose Example Match
. Matches any single
charactera.c aac , abc , a1c , a2c
^ Beginning of a line ^hat hat , hatch , not
chat
$ End of a line hat$ hat , chat , not
hatch
| Alt ernation job|task job or task
( ) Grouping job(12 |34) job12 or job34
\ Treat the following
special character
literally\$5\.6\\7 $5.6\7
The | alternates the longest possible string. That is, it matches job or task , and matches both jotask
and jobask .
Grouping with ( ) limits the alternate branches.
Character sets
Character sets
You can de fine  a set of characters within a string. Character sets match any single character enclosed in
square brackets [ ] . For example:Expression Match
j[oa]n jon or jan
Use the - character between two characters in a set to indicate a range. A - character outside of a set,
or at the beginning or end of a set, is treated literally. For example:
Expression Match
[a-c] a, b, or c
[1-3] 1, 2, or 3
[ab-] a, b, or -
[B-D]-3 B-3 , C-3 , or D-3
If the fir s t character in the set is ^, then the character set matches any character that is not in the list. For
example:
Expression Match
[^oa] Any character except o and a
All other special characters lose their meaning when included in a character set. For example:
Expression Match
^[^*\+.-] Line must not start with *, \, +, .,or -
To include a literal ] in the character set, make it the fir s t character in the set. It can also be excluded by
following ^. The ] character is also treated literally outside of a set. For example:
Expression Match
[^]a-] Any character besides ], a, and -
[]a] ] or a
[a]] a]
Quantifier s
Quantifier s
You can specify quantities  of character sets, grouped characters, or individual characters. The quantifier s
*, +, ?, and { } act on the preceding set, group, or individual character.
Character Purpose Example Match
* Specifies  0 or more
c onsecutiv e  occurrencesab*c ac, abc , abbbbc
+ Specifies  1 or more
c onsecutiv e  occurrencesab+c abc , abbbbc
? Specifies  0 or 1 occurrence colou?r (wo)?man color or colour
woman or man
{x} Exactly <x> occurrences ab{4}c abbbbc{x,y} At least <x>, no more than
<y> occurrencesab{2,4}c abbc , abbbc , abbbbc
{x,} At least <x> occurrences ab{2,}c abbc , abbbc
{,x} No more than <x>
occurrencesab{,2}c ac, abc , or abbc
Shorthand expressions
Shorthand expressions
The following expressions are shorthand for longer or more complex regular expressions:
Expression Purpose Example Match
[:alpha:] Matches must consist of
letter s.[:alpha:]8,16 aBcmGLeEhhi
[:digit:] Matches must consist of
digits. [:digit:] is equivalent
to [:d:] and \d.[[:digit:]]+ 2962954576
[:upper:] Matches must consist of
uppercase characters.[[:upper:]
[:digit:]]+9DDD4MLAG13
[:alnum:] Matches must be
alphanumeric. [:alnum:] is
short hand for [a-zA-Z0-9]
in the ascii character set,
but the use of [:alnum:] is
preferred for c ompatibility
with other languages and
character sets.[:alnum:]7[^[:digit:]] a3dM9DD+
Examples
Examples
Only allow letter s,  numbers, e x clamation  point, and
period^[a-zA-Z0-9!.] ⋆$
At most 8 characters long ^.,8$
Must start with a letter ^[a-zA-Z]
Must have a number [0-9]
Must end in -admin or -test (-admin |-test)$
Must begin with three capital letter s  and an underscore ^[A-Z] {3}_
