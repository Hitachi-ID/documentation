Adding email support
Bravura Security Fabric uses the pxnull interface program to send email when events are c onfigured  using
the Configure  event  (ITSM) module. You must install this program with the Connector Pack.
To set up email event actions  and compose message content, using the Con figur e  event  (ITSM) module:
1.Using the Con figur e  event (ITSM) module  (on page 1556), select 
  to Send email each time  this 1.
event occurs.
2.Type text into each field.  You can include variable strings as placeholders for variable text, and M4 2.
macros as well. These can be included in the Subject and Message body .
For example, for the DB_REPLICATION_CONN_FAILURE event, you could enter values as follows:
3.Click Update . 3.After  you click Update , any M4 macros that you’ve included are expanded to show their Displayed
value. Repeat step 1 to see the Displayed value. Variable strings are not expanded, because their
values vary depending on when the event occurs.
4.Click Back to add more event actions. 4.
Adding event action  variable strings in email messages
When you compose message content using the Con figur e  event  (ITSM) module, you can include variables
in the Subject  and Message body that expand to e v en t -specific  in f ormation.  The following variables are
available:
Event action  variable strings

The strings are c ase-sensitive .Con figuring  of %LTIME% event action  variable.
Use the %LTIME% variable to display the local time  zone within email messages triggered by event
actions.  This variable requires the cr eation  of a new pr ofile  attribut e  named PREFERRED_TIMEZONE . The
attribut e  PREFERRED_TIMEZONE must be set to a supported time  zone in the same format specified  by
those in the following registry key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
\Time Zones 
For example if UTC-0700 was the time  zone of the user, the following would be a valid value:
Mountain Standard Time  
The email action  c on figur ation  file
When you c on figur e  an email action  for an event using the Con figur e  event  (ITSM) module, Bravura
Security Fabric  aut omatic ally  creates a pxnull-itsm.cfg file in the script directory. This file contains
the mail server settings  you set in Manage the system > W orkflow  > Email c on figur ation .
If you change the mail server settings,  you must update the pxnull-itsm.cfg  file by:
▪Manually editing  the file ▪
▪Adding or updating  any event c on figur ation  that includes an email action,  to allow Bravura Security ▪
Fabric  to regenerate the file
Adding macros to email messages
When you compose message content using the Con figur e  event  (ITSM) module, you can use M4 macros
that expand to text strings, in the language of the user. These macros can be used in the Subject and
Message body of message content. The macros can include HTML code to enhance the display of
message content.
The M4 system and requirements are detailed in the CUSTOMIZATION  (on page 3471).
To use M4 macros, type the corresponding tag, beginning with !!! , in the relevant fields  on the Edit
email page; for example:
!!!ADMIN_GROUP_TITLE
To learn how to:
▪Add HTML code to enhance the display of the message content, see CUSTOMIZATION  (on page 3471). ▪
▪Modify the text de fined  by the M4 macros, see CUSTOMIZATION  (on page 3471). ▪
The message subject line can contain macros that expand to text, but you cannot include HTML code
in the subject.
Adding custom tags
To add customized messages to Con figur e  event  (ITSM) module message fields:1.Create itsm.m4 in <instance>\design\custom \, if it does not already exist. 1.
2.Add lines to the custom file in the following format: 2.
!!!<MESSAGE_TAG>
<text>
where <text>  can include HTML code and M4 macros.
For example:
!!!SIMPLE_MESSAGE_TAG
Have a <strong>good</strong> day.
!!!TRANSLATABLE_MESSAGE
CUSTOM_MACRO_1
CUSTOM_MACRO_2
CUSTOM_MACRO_ 3
3.To de fine  text in multiple  languages, create the <lang >-<locale >-language.kvg file for each 3.
supported language in <instance>\design\custom \if it does not already exist.
If you want the email to be translated, the To: field  must be a single person, either the recipient
(%RECIPIENT_EMAIL%) or the requester (%REQUESTER_EMAIL%) of the operation  or event being
trapped. The user’s last used language in the Bravura Security Fabric web interface will be the
language the email will be translated in (as determined by the userid’s LASTLANG tag value in the
USERSTAT table).
Edit the macro de finitions  as required, in the format:  
    "CUSTOM_MACRO_1" "" = { 
       "text" = "This is the first line of the message" 
     } 
     "CUSTOM_MACRO_2" "" = { 
       "text" = "... the second" 
     } 
     "CUSTOM_MACRO_3" "" = { 
       "text" = "...and the third.<br>Signed, your company" 
     } 
4.In the relevant field  in the Manage the system  (PSA) module Edit email  page, type the corresponding tag 4.
beginning with !!! from itsm.m4 .
5.Recompile and install your skin (*.z) files by running make.bat in the design directory. 5.
See CUSTOMIZATION  (on page 3471) for more in f ormation.
Deleting  email event actions
To delete the email action  for a c on figur ed  event, click 
  in the Send email  row in the Con figur e  event
(ITSM) module.Adding programs to run
Bravura Security Fabric aut omatic ally  c on figur es  certain programs to run when you set up actions  as
described in Adding email support  (on page 1562) and Con figuring  tick e t  updates  (on page 1558). For
other interface programs, you must write a c on figur ation  script for the program. You can c on figur e
multiple  programs for the same event.
To set up scripted programs to run when certain events occur on the Bravura Security Fabric server:
1.Type the name of the programs, or tick e t  system target IDs, to be invoked when the event occurs. 1.
You can do this in the appropriate c on figur ation  page, or Using the Con figur e  event (ITSM) module  (on
page 1556).
When adding program names, you must include the full name; for example pxrem.exe. Do not include
path inf ormation.
You can specify a c onfiguration  file with the -cfg parameter, described on the current page.
2.Click Update . 2.
3.Write a script file that de fines  the in t er action  between Bravura Security Fabric and the interface 3.
program. You can de fine  a diff er en t  sequence of actions  for every type of event. Default script file
names correspond to the interface program name.
Using target ID's
When using tick e t  system target IDs, you can specify alternate c on figur ation  files.  For example, assuming
you have a Remedy Action  Request System 9.0+ (Ticket) target with an ID of ARS7, you can add:
▪pxrem9.exe▪
or
▪ARS9▪
In both cases, the pxrem9 program will use the default script pxrem9.cfg in the script directory.
You can specify an alt ernativ e  c on figur ation  file using the -cfg parameter; for example:
▪pxrem9.exe -cfg myfile.cfg▪
or
▪ARS9 -cfg myfile.cfg▪
In both cases, the pxrem9 program will use the script myfile.cfg in the script directory.
It is recommended that you use a target system ID in this field.  The bene fit  is that all sensitiv e
in f ormation  (server address, admin cr edentials)  is aut omatic ally  passed to the program, rather than
stored in the .cfg file in plain text. This enhances security.
You must specify an alt ernativ e  .cfg file when when you have multiple  tick e t  targets of the same type; for
example, ARS1 and ARS2. If you wanted to c on figur e  event actions  only for the ARS1 target, then the
program to run would be: ARS1-cfg ARS1_file.cfg .The cfg file name must not contain the string -itsm ; for example, myfile.cfg is allowed, but my-
itsm.cfg is not.Part VI PASSPart I Self-Service Password ResetImplementing  self-service password reset
Bravura Pass  is an integrated solution  for managing cr edentials  across systems and applic ations.  It
simplifies  the management of passwords, tokens, smart cards, security questions  and biometrics.
Bravura Pass  lowers IT support cost and improves the security of login processes.
Bravura Pass  includes password s ynchr oniz ation,  self-service password and PIN reset, strong
authentic ation,  federated access, enrollment of security questions  and biometrics and self-service unlock
of encrypted drives.
You can c on figur e  Bravura Pass  to allow users to change f or g otten  passwords, synchronize some or all of
their passwords, or unlock accounts.
Answer the following questions  to determine the best solution  for self -service password reset:
▪Will users be r esetting  their password only from a locally connected network? ▪
▪Will users need to reset their password from remote loc ations  such as a WiFi hotspot? ▪
▪Will the Cr edential  Provider be installed on a user’s w ork s t ation  to provide a tile users can click to ▪
reset their password?
▪Do users rely on cached passwords when not connected directly to the domain?▪
Self-service password reset provides the following solutions:
1.Web-based password management  (on page 1573) - includes self-service if the user can access 1.
Bravura Pass and assisted password changes.
2.Local Reset Extension  (on page 1578) - updates cached network cr edentials  on a user’s Windows 2.
client w ork s t ation  after  a successful web-based password reset. This addresses the issue of intruder
lock-outs caused by w ork s t ations  c ontinuing  to log into network resources using cached, no-longer-
valid passwords.
3.Login Assistant - uses a secure kiosk account (SKA); to provide users with secure access to the Bravura3.
Pass password change interface. Login Assistant also includes an optional  Cr edential  Provider
extension to provide a Change my password  tile on the Windows login screen.
▪Local Secure Kiosk Account and Cr edential  Provider  (on page 1593) ▪

▪Self Service Anywhere set up Login Assistant for remote users  (on page 1628) ▪
The following sections  describe the core features:
Self-service password changes
Users who have f or g otten  a password or triggered an intruder lockout can sign into Bravura Pass  using
other types of cr edentials  to reset their password or clear the lockout. Non-password authentic ation
options  include security questions,  voice biometrics, smart cards, hardware tokens and random PINs sent
to a user’s mobile phone using SMS.
