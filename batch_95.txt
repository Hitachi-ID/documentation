5.Add the Salesforce service provider to the Bravura Security Fabric  IdP server 5.If your SP has a pre c on figur ed  templates  (on page 929) follow this process to integrate the SP with
Bravura Security Fabric  IdP:
1.As superuser on the IdP server navigate to Manage external data store > sp_mapping 1.
2.Enable the sp_mapping table issuer that corresponds to your service provider:2.
▪Rows will exist for the following SPs: bamboohr, google, webex, hcpa, adfs, youtrack, salesforce▪
and azure.
▪All rows have a value of 0 in the enabled column, by default. Change the value in the row for▪
your service provider to 1.
▪Ensure the following field  values match the values used on the service provider. In Salesforce ▪
these values can be found in the SAML Single Sign on settings.
▪issuer In Salesforce this is called the Entity  ID ▪
▪sp_folder contains __non_saml__, and <sp folder name on the Bravura Security Fabric  IdP ▪

3. Optional:  As superuser on the IdP server navigate to Manage external data store > sp_access and 3.
edit the following entries if you want to restrict access to the service provider to a more specific  set
of users:

6.Click Update 6.
.
6.Test the login process6.
7.Log into Salesforce via Bravura Security Fabric : 7.a.On the Salesforce login page, select the new option  to login using the SAML IdP . a.
You will be redirected to Bravura Security Fabric .
b. Authentic a t e  into Bravura Security Fabric  as an end user that wants access to Salesforce. b.
After  successfully authentic ating  with Bravura Security Fabric  you will be redirected back to
Salesforce and be logged in.By default the Salesforce c onfiguration  in Bravura Security Fabric assumes that the EMAIL profile
attribut e  is what should be sent to Salesforce as the Name Identifier  as the subject of the assertion.
If this is not the case and a diff eren t  mapping is needed, you can edit this in the saml-response.xml
file in the following folder: C:\Program Files\Bravura Security\Bravura
Security Fabric\\samlhids\idp\salesforce\
Service provider with no pr e-c on figur ed  template in Bravura Security Fabric
If support for your service provider  is not included in Bravura Security Fabric  by default, it can be added
manually.
1.Create a new folder to hold the service provider’s SAML assertion  template in the <instance> \idp 1.
\<new sp folder> directory.
You can give this folder any name. Take note of this folder name. It will be added to the sp_access
table in a later step.
2.Copy the XML template file from an e xisting  sp_folder over to your new service provider folder. 2.
3.Edit the new saml-response.xml to ensure the assertion  includes all requirements for the 3.
service provider you are c on figuring.
4.Follow the vendor's steps to prepare the service provider. During the setup you will be prompted for4.
the xml file created in step 3.
5.As superuser on the IdP server navigate to EXTDB > sp_mapping 5.
6.Add a new entry with values:6.
▪issuer:  "%SP server's BASE IDSYNCH URL%/SP/" ▪
▪sp_folder:  <sp folder name on the Bravura Security Fabric  IdP server> ▪
▪acs_url:  The endpoint login url ▪
▪idp_url:  This must exactly match the "identity  provider issuer" value. http s://<Br a vur a  Security ▪
Host>/instance/sso/ is most commonly used.
▪enabled:  1 ▪

▪relay_state : <value provided by the SP vendor >. The RelayState will be provided to the SP during ▪
an IdP initia t ed  flo w  if required.
▪sig_loc : Assert ▪
7.Click Update 7.
8.As superuser on the IdP server navigate to Manage external data store > sp_access and add a new 8.
entry with the values:
▪sp_folder: contains __non_saml__, and <sp folder name> ▪

Test the c onfigur ation
Two Bravura Security Fabric  instances should now be c on figur ed  to authentic a t e  via SAML. To test this:
1.Open the SP instance login page1.
2.Submit the username of one of the test accounts that is a member of SAML_USERS.2.
You should be redirected to IdP's login page
3.Complete the authentic ation  process, using valid cr edentials. 3.
Login uses the SAML authentic ation  chain.
Upon successful authentic ation,  the user’s web browser is redirected back to the service provider, where
they are logged in aut omatic ally .
Example: Con figur e  Bravura Security Fabric as an SP and integrate with a Bravura Security Fabric IdP server
Bravura Security Fabric  can be c on figur ed  to operate as a service provider and as an identity  provider,
providing a federated login solution.
As an identity  provider, Bravura Security Fabric  provides unified  third-party authentic ation  for a variety of
f eder ation-c apable  applic ations  using the Bravura Security Fabric  login process, reducing the burden of
managing multiple  app-specific  cr edentials.  Once users authentic a t e  they are redirected back to the
applic ation  along with a cryptographically signed SAML assertion  indic ating  who they are (identity),  and
what they may access (authoriz ation).
The following example describes how to c on figur e  Bravura Security Fabric  as a SP and how integrate with
a Bravura Security Fabric  IdP .

Set up Bravura Security Fabric as an identity  provider (IdP)
The Scenario.hid_saml_idp component installs the functionality  to allow Bravura Security Fabric  to act as
an identity  provider, enabling it to authentic a t e  end users on behalf of a variety of web applic ations.
1.Install Bravura Security Fabric  and connector packs. 1.
2.Log in to the front end as superuser.2.3.Click Manage the system > W orkflo w  > Email c on figur ation 3.
4.Set BASE_IDSYNCH_URL  to the servername used in the IIS TLS certific a t e,  which is the URL seen by 4.
the end users' browsers.
If that URL ever changes, the idp-metadata  file must be edited to global-replace the old server
name with the new one.
5.Click Home > Manage components . 5.
6.Install the Scenario.hid_saml_idp component.6.
7. Con figur e  the ” AD” target system that was added by the component: 7.
a.Update the target system address.a.
b.Update cr edentials. b.
c.Test the c onnection. c.
An e xisting  Source of Pr ofiles  target can be used.
8.Run auto discovery to import user pr ofiles  into the Bravura Security Fabric  database. 8.
9.Verify the rule in table hid_authchain_select:9.
RuleNumber =120
Comment SAML authentic ation  chain
Proceed False
MatchType sessdata
MatchKey SAML_REQUEST
Ma t chCondition set
MatchValue <null>
Action flush
ChainId SAML
Installing this component in stand-alone mode on a new instance will override all default
authentic ation  chains, and may prevent non-SAML and console users from logging into Bravura
Security Fabric. To avoid this, c onfirm  that the hid_authchain_select table includes a valid chain for
users authentic ating  without a SAML_REQUEST before c ontinuing.
10. Navigate to the IdP instance's \install\idp directory and copy idp-metadata.xml  to a loc ation 10.
where it can be accessed by the Bravura Security Fabric  IdP server in order to finish  c on figuring  the
authentic ation  chain module.
11. Create a new folder to hold the service provider’s SAML assertion  template in the <instance> \idp\ 11.
directory; for example <instance>\idp\<new sp folder>.
