This chapter details how to create and maintain the OrgChart as a product administrator .
The Bravura Security Fabric  OrgChart c ons truction  process either begins with:
▪A list of users and no data about their r elationship s. ▪
In this case, the or g aniz ational  r elationship s  must be identified  and c on figur ed.  You must identif y  the
top-level manager, then either manually identif y  r elationship s,  or start an Org building round.
▪A list of users with their or g aniz ational  r elationship s  already de fined. ▪
In this case, the or g aniz ational  in f ormation  was already de fined  on the target system and has been
imported into Bravura Security Fabric . The process in this case will consist of verifying the
or g aniz ational  data and adjusting  it if necessary.
See Mapping attribut es  for or g aniz ation  chart management  (on page 2500) to learn how to import
r elationship  data from a target system.
The following terms are important in this chapter:
Manager In the OrgChart, this is a user who has subordinates.
Subordinate This is a user who reports to another user.
Top-level manager This manager is the root of the OrgChart, and does not
report to anyone.
Org building round This is a server-driven process that invites managers to
name their subordinates in a top-down sequence.
Managers login to Bravura Security Fabric  to identif y
their subordinates and which of them are managers
themselves. The process cascades down until  all levels
of management have been involved. You can start Org
building rounds to initially  build the OrgChart, or to
periodically verify data.
This chapter shows you how to:
▪ Initia t e  the Org building process if you are St arting  with no data  (on page 2504). ▪
▪Changing the top-level manager  (on page 2506) if there has been a change at the top. ▪
▪ Updating  the OrgChart  (on page 2508) ▪
▪Managing Org building rounds  (on page 2510) ▪
▪Browse the OrgChart▪St arting  with no data
If you import initial  or g aniz ation  chart data from a target system or other source, the top manager should
already be de fined.  If you are beginning with no r elationship  data, you must begin OrgChart c ons truction
by identif ying  the top-level manager.
The following security privileges control access to the Manage the OrgChart  (IDG) module:
▪Product administrators with the ”Manage the OrgChart” adminis tr ativ e  privilege can update the ▪
OrgChart and view the OrgChart structure.
▪Product administrators with the ”Start Org building rounds” adminis tr ativ e  privilege can initia t e ▪

down to the next level until  all levels of management have been involved. The end result is a v erified
OrgChart that has been signed off by all the managers participating  in the process.
After  the OrgChart has been de fined  you should c ontinue  to maintain it by periodically r e vie wing /
v alidating  either the OrgChart itself or sections  of it. This is especially applicable for sections  of your
or g aniz ation  that are experiencing high growth, turnover, or have been reduced by la y off s.  You can carry
