Windows-based OID-LDAP servers
To install the OID-LDAP password filt er  plugin (psldap.dll) on a Windows Server 2003-based LDAP server:
1.Log into the server hosting  the OID-LDAP Applic ation  Server with adminis tr ativ e  privileges. 1.
2.Stop the OID-LDAP Applic ation  Server. 2.
3.Copy psldap-oidldap.dll  from addon \transparent-synch\ldap\ on the Bravura Security Fabric 3.
server to $ORACLE_HOME/lib on the OID-LDAP server as psldap.dll .
You can place this binary somewhere else, but you must edit files in the next steps accordingly.
ORACLE_HOME is the destination  directory specified  during the Oracle Applic ation  Server
Infrastructure ins t allation.
4.Copy psldap.cfg from the addon transparent-synch\ldap\ directory on the Bravura Security Fabric 4.
server to %ORACLE_HOME%\lib on the OID-LDAP server.
5.Copy the libidapi.dll file from the <instance>\lib\ directory on your Bravura Pass  server to 5.
<Program Files path>\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\<instance>\ lib\.
6.Copy the idapitool.exe  file from the <instance>\lib\ directory on your Bravura Pass  server to 6.
<Program Files path>\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\<instance>\ .
Edit psldap.cfg as follows:
▪comm-key De fines  the private key used for encr yption.  This key must match the one set during ▪
ins t allation  on the Bravura Security Fabric  server.  
  comm-key =  "<encrypted commkey value>";  
▪ t ar g etid  This option  is used to specify the ID of the target system associated with this interceptor.  ▪
  targetid = "ldap";  
▪libcurl The full path to the libcurl shared object required when using SSL. An empty value uses the ▪
system default loc ation,  otherwise the full path can specified.  A value of ’0’ disables libcurl which
ultima t ely  disables SSL and web proxy f acilities.   
   libcurl = "0";  
▪url The URL option  specifies  the service endpoint of the API SOAP Service.  ▪
   url = "http://host.domain.com/default/idapi";  
▪user The user ID the API SOAP Service is c on figur ed  to use.  ▪   user = "_API_USER";  
▪psw The password the API SOAP Service is c on figur ed  to use. Use the idapitool program to acquire ▪
this value from the known plain text value. See the " Bravura Security Fabric  Remote API" guide for
idapitool usage in f ormation.   
   psw = "the_encrypted_password_created_by_idapitool";  
You can generate the encrypted password with the following command: 
    idapitool.exe -url http://host.domain.com/default/idapi -
user _API_USER -psw Letmein1 -q  
7. Optionally ,  edit these keys: 7.
▪proxy The proxy option  specifies  the address and port.  ▪
   proxy = "http://idapi_proxy.mydomain.com:3128";  
▪proxyuser The username to authentic a t e  against the proxy. (optional)   ▪
   proxyuser = "proxyuser";  
▪proxypath The password to authentic a t e  against the proxy. (optional)   ▪
   proxypass = "proxypass";  
▪capath The CA directory or file holding the root certific a t es  to trust. This value is required if using ▪
SSL.  
   capath = "";  
▪cert The certific a t e  for client authentic ation.  This value is optional  when using SSL and may be used ▪
if client v erific ation  is required by the server.  
   cert = "ldap.crt";  
▪ignore Whether or not to enforce strict name checking of the server certific a t e.   ▪
   ignore = "0";  
▪ timeout  Specifies  the timeout  when c ommunic ating  with IDAPI SOAP service. The default timeout ▪
is 300 seconds.  
   timeout = "300";  
▪ r e tr y -attemp ts  Specifies  the retry attemp ts  for failed IDAPI calls. The default r e tr y -attemp ts  value is ▪
2.  
   retry-attempts = "2";  
▪retry-delay  Specifies  the retry delay between IDAPI calls. The default retry-delay is 5 seconds.  ▪
   retry-delay = "5";  
▪fail-if-unavailable Specifies  if password changes should fail if the IDAPI SOAP service cannot be ▪
contacted. The default behavior is to always fail if IDAPI SOAP service is unavailable.  
   fail-if-unavailable = "true";  
▪strength-check-only  If this option  is set to true, the password reset oper ation  will not occur. The ▪
default value is set to true.  
   strength-check-only = "true";  
8.On the OID-LDAP server create the following registry keys:  8.HKLM\SOFTWARE\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\<instance>\
Entry name  PsldapCfg
Value  Path to psldap.cfg file
Data type  REG_DWORD  
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\<instance>\
Entry name  PsInstallDir
Value The full directory path of the psldap.cfg file
Data type  REG_SZ
9.Edit the listener.ora file in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin to permit access to the shared object. 9.
Add the path to the library to the oracle environment variable EXTPROC_DLLS. This must match the
path to the psldap.so  binary.
For example:
  SID_LIST_LISTENER = 
    (SID_LIST = 
      (SID_DESC = 
        (SID_NAME = PLSExtProc) 
        (ORACLE_HOME = C:\oracle) 
        (PROGRAM = extproc) 
        (ENVS="EXTPROC_DLLS=C:\oracle\lib\psldap.dll") 
      ) 
    )
10. Edit psldap-oidldap-plugin.sql to set the path to the library in the plugin. This must match the path to 10.
the psldap.so  binary.
For example:
  CREATE OR REPLACE LIBRARY psldap_lib AS 
  'C:\oracle\lib\psldap.dll'; 
  / 
  SHOW ERRORS
11. Install psldap-oidldap-plugin.sql. This file contains stored procedures needed for the plugin. You can 11.
install it, for example, by e x ecuting  the command:  
  sqlplus ods/<odspassword> @<pathto psldap-oidldap-plugin.sql>  
on the database server, where ods is the OID Database Schema owner
For example: 
  $ORACLE_HOME/bin/sqlplus ods/mypass @psldap-oidldap-plugin.sql  
12. Set up the plugin in the LDAP server. This can be done either from the GUI by hand, or using the 12.
supplied pluginreg.dat. Using pluginreg.dat from the LDAP server, run the command:    ldapadd -p <portnum> -h <hostname> -D cn=orcladmin \ 
        -w <orcladminpassword> -v \ 
        -f <pathto psldap-oidldap-pluginreg.dat>  
where:
▪port is the port that the OID-LDAP server listens on - default is 389 ▪
▪hostname is the host name of OID-LDAP server - localhost can be used. ▪
For example: 
  $ORACLE_HOME/bin/ldapadd -p 389 -h myhost -D cn=orcladmin -
w mypass -v -f psldap-oidldap-pluginreg.dat  
13. Restart the Oracle listener using the Windows Service Control Manager. 13.

Mainframe Connector can intercept password changes on OS/390 or z/OS mainframes, with RACF, ACF2
or TopSecret security softw ar e.  This is done by inserting  an exit trap into the security system, and by
installing an authorized task which starts at IPL.
The c ombination  of an exit and task apply password strength rules de fined  on the Bravura Pass  server to
all new password selections,  made using any user interface, nativ ely  on MVS or OS390. The task forwards
a request for s ynchr oniz ation  to the Bravura Pass  server after  every successful mainframe password
change.
Before installing the exit and task on your mainframe, be sure to inform your users that:
▪All mainframe password changes for users who appear in the Bravura Pass  server’s user database will ▪
be subjected to the password policy enforced on the Bravura Pass  server.
▪When users who are de fined  on the Bravura Pass  server change their passwords on the mainframe, ▪
their new password will be aut omatic ally  applied to all of their other accounts, on other systems
de fined  on the Bravura Pass  server.
Refer to the Mainframe Connector Ins t allation  and Con figur ation  Guide  for detailed ins tructions  about
installing and c on figuring  the exit and task on your security system (RACF, ACF2 or TopSecret).
Note: If you install Mainframe Connector, but do not install the password exit in
your security product, then Bravura Pass  will be able to manage
mainframe passwords, but transparent password s ynchr oniz ation  will not
be triggered by nativ e  mainframe password changes.
Con figuring  the Password Manager service for transparent s ynchr oniz ation
The interceptor installed with Mainframe Connector uses a legacy protocol to communicate with the
Password Manager service  (on page 2820) ( idpm ). You must c on figur e  the Password Manager service for
backward c ompatibility:
▪Set the following field  to use the port c on figur ed  for this interceptor (default 3333): ▪
Enable this port for backward c ompatibility  (to communicate with older interceptors/triggers). Must
be diff er en t  from Port number above
▪Add a CIDR mask address for the trigger system in the following setting: ▪
Comma-delimited list of IP addresses with CIDR bitmask that are allowed to send socket requests
If using load balancers, do not c on figur e  any SSL options  for transparent s ynchr oniz ation  tr a ffic.  SSL options
should only be c on figur ed  on load balancers for WebUI tr a ffic,  not transparent s ynchr oniz ation.  Transparent
s ynchr oniz ation  is encrypted using a proprietary encr yption  algorithm. Contact support@bravurasecurity.com
for more details.OS/400 trigger
Bravura Pass  can intercept password changes on an IBM OS/400 system. This is done by installing an exit
program, pspwdexit_v5r4m0 or pspwdexit_v7r1m0 , which implements the
QIBM_QSY_VLD_PASSWRD exit point on the OS/400 system. The exit program informs Bravura Pass
when a password is changed. It also allows Bravura Pass  to check who is changing whose password. If a
user tries to change another user’s password, the attemp t  is blocked and a warning is sent to a specified
administrator.
Bravura Pass  ships with two exit programs for OS/400, pspwdexit_v5r4m0 for the IBM i7.1
oper ating  system and pspwdexit_v7r1m0 for the IBM i7.2 oper ating  system.
This chapter details how to c on figur e  transparent password s ynchr oniz ation  on an OS/400 system by:
1. Cr eating  and applying a password policy 1.
2.Installing and c on figuring  pspwdexit 2.
3. Con figuring  the Password Manager service (idpm) 3.
4.Verifying the c on figur ation 4.
These steps are detailed in the sections  that follow.
This chapter assumes you have set up an os400 target system and tested it’s c on figur ation  according to
Connector Pack  documen t ation .
Cr eating  and applying a password policy
Before installing and c on figuring  the Bravura Pass  transparent password s ynchr oniz ation  softw ar e  on the
OS/400 server, you need to create a password strength policy for the OS/400 server:
1. Con figur e  a password strength policy.  (on page 999) 1.
Set the Maximum number of lowercase letter s  to 0. Passwords on the OS/400 system cannot include
lowercase letter s.  Con figur e  other parameters as required.
2.Create a target system group2.
▪Ensure that the Use transparent password s ynchr oniz ation  checkbox is selected. ▪
▪Select the password policy that you created.▪
1.Make the OS/400 server a member of the target system group.1.
Once you have applied the password policy and installed the exit programs on an OS/400 server, be sure
to inform your users that:
▪All future password changes are subjected to the password policy enforced by the Bravura Pass  server. ▪
▪When they change their password on the OS/400 server, their new password is aut omatic ally  applied ▪
to all their other accounts managed by the Bravura Pass  server.
▪Their new password must be all uppercase.▪Installing and c on figuring  pspwdexit
The pspwdexit_v5r4m0 and pspwdexit_v7r1m0 programs are installed in the \<instance>

OS/400 system components
Component Description
PSPWDEXIT The exit programs work with the
QIBM_QSY_VLD_PASSWRD exit point. Use the
ADDEXITPGM command to add the exit point.
You also need to set the QPWDVLDPGM system value to
*REGFAC. The advantage of this, is that it can check who
is changing whose password. Users are not allowed to
change others users’ passwords. If this is attemp t ed,  a
warning message is sent to an administrator MSGUSER.
MSGUSER The user that adminis tr ativ e  messages are sent to. If the
user is not specified,  messages are sent to QSYSOPR. If a
nonexistent user is specified,  messages are not sent. Field
length is 10.
MSGLEVEL The adminis tr ativ e  message level settings  that are
logged. The default level is 3. The value can be set to the
following: 0 (No logging), 1 (Error), 2 (Warning), 3
(Notice),  4 (Info), 5 (Debug)
PSSERVER The Bravura Pass  server’s network name or IP address.
Field length is 50.
PSPORT The Password Manager service port number. Field length
is 5.
COMMKEY The Bravura Pass  c ommunic ation  key (or Master Key) in
the encrypted format. Field length is 80.
TARGETID The target ID of the OS/400 server as it is identified  in
Bravura Pass . Field length is 80.
TIMEOUT The default timeout  value for c onnecting  to Password
Manager service is 8 seconds. If the network is slow, a
greater value may be needed. Field length is 2.
FAILPPDOWN The behavior when Password Manager service cannot be
contacted. By default it is 0 and the CHGPWD is still
permitted  if it cannot be contacted. If set to 1, CHGPWD
is rejected if Password Manager service cannot be
contacted.

Con figuring  the Password Manager service for transparent s ynchr oniz ation
To allow external servers access to the Password Manager service  (on page 2820) (idpm) on the primary
Bravura Security Fabric  server you must also add a CIDR mask address for the trigger system.
1.Click Manage the system > Maintenance > Services . 1.
2.Select Bravura Security (idpm) Password Manager Service . 2.
3.Add a CIDR mask address for the trigger system in the following setting: 3.
Comma-delimited list of IP addresses with CIDR bitmask that are allowed to send socket requests
Verifying the c on figur ation
Verify that the transparent password s ynchr oniz ation  trigger is working as expected. Log into the OS/400
server and change the password of a user that Bravura Pass  is managing. Ensure that the password
change was captured by Bravura Pass  and propagated to other target systems.Password s ynchr oniz ation  r egis tr ation
When transparent password s ynchr oniz ation  (on page 1651) is implemented, it is important for users to
understand the new password c omposition  rules that Bravura Pass  enforces over nativ e  password
changes made on individual systems. Users also need to understand that password s ynchr oniz ation  takes
place aut omatic ally  after  they change their own password on a trigger system.
Bravura Pass  incorporates a web-based r egis tr ation  module, intended to prompt users for activ e
c on firmation  that they understand what transparent s ynchr oniz ation  does for them. When the Password
s ynchr oniz ation  r egis tr ation  (PSR) module is activ a t ed,  users are not a ff ect ed  by transparent password
s ynchr oniz ation  until  they activ ely  “register” for it.
The Password s ynchr oniz ation  r egis tr ation  (PSR) module is disabled by default. You must enable it to allow
users to access this feature.
Bravura Security  recommends that password s ynchroniz ation  be applied to all users. R egis tration  can be
used to implement password s ynchroniz ation  on a user-by-user basis; however, there are inc ompatibilities
between password s ynchroniz ation  regis tration  and IVR and the Bravura Pass API. If password
s ynchroniz ation  regis tration  is enabled, IVR and the Bravura Pass API may not be able to find users.
It is recommended that password s ynchr oniz ation  r egis tr ation  only be used as an educ ational  tool. If this
module is not enabled, all Bravura Pass  users are aut omatic ally  subjected to password s ynchr oniz ation
when it is activ a t ed.  You can enforce r egis tr ation  via the PSF FORCE ENROLLMENT  setting  (on page 1183).
To c on figur e  password s ynchr oniz ation  r egis tr ation:
1.Click Manage the system  > Modules > Password s ynchr oniz ation  r egis tr ation  (PSR) . 1.
2.Turn on the PSR ENABLED setting. 2.
3.If required, c on figur e  event options,  listed below. 3.
4.Click Update to submit the changes. 4.
5.Restart the Password Manager service to apply your settings. 5.
The Password Manager service must be restarted after  transparent s ynchroniz ation  is enabled. If it is
not restarted, users may remain aut omatic ally  subjected to transparent s ynchroniz ation  despite not
being actively  registered for it.
Password s ynchr oniz ation  r egis tr ation  (PSR) module events that launch interface programs
The following Password s ynchr oniz ation  r egis tr ation  (PSR) module options  can be accessed from Manage the
