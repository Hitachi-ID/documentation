▪nplocalr.ocx is designed to update locally protected resources. It can be used to clear PGP WDE ▪
cache passwords so that the new password can be used on the next start-up of the PGP client.
See Hard Drive Encr yption  Systems  in the Connector Pack documen t ation  for in f ormation  about
in t egr ating  with PGP WDE encr yption  clients.
▪hidgeneric.ocx  is a generic control that can be used to determine the correct bitness of ▪
*localr.ocx  to launch after  a password changes in order to update cached passwords on a user’s
w ork s t ation.
Notes
▪32 bit and 64 bit versions of cgilocalr.ocx  and nplocalr.ocx  are available. The bitness to ▪
launch is determined from the oper ating  system.
Usage
The cgilocalr plugin triggers local resource updates when a self-service password reset succeeds on
a target system as specified  in cgilocalr.cfg .
To enable cgilocalr :
1.Click Manage the system > Modules > Change passwords  (PSS ). 1.
2.Add cgilocalr.exe  in the S STATUS EXT  field. 2.
The field  accepts a comma-delimited list for multiple  plugins.
3.Click Update . 3.
Requirements
The cgilocalr plugin requires a c on figur ation  file. The cgilocalr.cfg  file in the samples\
directory includes example c on figur ations  for pslocalr.ocx , nplocalr.ocx  and
hidgeneric.ocx . Copy the file to the \<instance>\script\ directory, then edit the c on figur ation.
Generic control
The generic control can determine which bitness of *localr.ocx to launch based on the browsers
requirements.
The generic control requires the following parameters for running arbitrary commands:
▪id Used to identif y  the generic control ▪
▪ files  Download from Bravura Pass  instance server’s directory wwwdocs/x86 or wwwdocs/x64 ▪
depending on the client w ork s t ation  oper ating  system’s bitness.
▪program (optional)  The program to run in the cgilocalr plugin. ▪
If left blank, rundll32.exe will be used.
▪arguments Arguments or parameters to pass to the program or rundll32.exe . ▪Cus t omiz ation
You can customize the user interface text in the plugin-pslocalr.m4  file. The Activ eX ’ s  result
messages can also be modified  in this M4 file. See CUSTOMIZATION  (on page 3471) for more in f ormation.
Use case
The cgilocalr plugin uses the c on figur ation  file to specify the target system and AD domain for
which passwords should be changed locally, where:
▪Each target system on which you want to enable the Local Reset must have an entry containing the▪
target system ID.
▪Legacy Activ e  Directory target systems must have a logonDomain value. Users passwords will only be ▪
reset if they are logged on to their w ork s t ation  with cr edentials  from this domain.
▪ t ar g etid,  control and logonDomain are case insensitiv e. ▪
Note: For Activ e  Directory DN targets, the domain in f ormation  is taken implicitly
from the longid, and does not need to be explicitly specified  by
logonDomain, which is only used for legacy Activ e  Directory target
systems.
For example, a company has an Activ e  Directory Domain Controller managing the domain OFFICE. A
target system for this domain controller has already been added with a target system ID of INTERNAL-AD.
The following script c on figur es  the Local Reset Extension for passwords changed using the web-based
interface. The user must be logged onto a w ork s t ation  that is a member of the domain OFFICE. When the
user changes his password on INTERNAL-AD the plugin will immediately update the user’s local Windows
password cache. Either pslocalr or generic can be used.
# NOTE: This example is for backwards compatibility only, use of the
# pslocalr control directly should be changed to use the generic
# control as described in Generic Control example below.
#
# cgilocalr plugin config file to use pslocalr
 # KVGROUP-V2.0
 "" "" = {
   "targetid" "INTERNAL-AD" = {
     "control" "pslocalr" = {
       "protocol" = "2";
       "attributes" "" = {
         "logonDomain" = "OFFICE";
       };
     };
   };
 };
or#
 # cgilocalr plugin config file to use generic control
 # KVGROUP-V2.0
 "" "" = {
   "targetid" "INTERNAL-AD" = {
    "control" "generic" = {
       "id" = "pslocalr";
       "files" "" = {
         "file" = "pslocalr.ocx";
       };
       "arguments" = "pslocalr.ocx,ResetCachedPassword2 %HID_ENCRYPTED_DATA
%";
       "attributes" "" = {
         "logonDomain" = "OFFICE";
       };
     };
   };
 };
Furthermore, w ork s t ation  lock down after  successfully updating  the user’s local Windows password
cache also can be c on figur ed  by adding "useLockWstn" = "true" to the c on fig  file using the generic
control. For example,
"" "" = {
  "targetid" "INTERNAL-AD" = {
    "control" "generic" = {
      "id" = "pslocalr";
      "files" "" = {
        "file" = "pslocalr.ocx";
      };
      "arguments" = "pslocalr.ocx,ResetCachedPassword2 %HID_ENCRYPTED_DATA
%";
      "attributes" "" = {
        "logonDomain" = "OFFICE";
        "useLockWstn" = "true";
      };
    };
  };
};T esting
To test the correctness of the c on figur ation  file, attemp t  a password reset for one of the users on that
system. If the syntax of the c on figur ation  file is invalid, the end user will not see any errors, but the server
will log details about the parse error encountered:
   Failed to parse file [C:\<path-to-instance>\script\cgilocalr.cfg]:
   [Line: 36, Pos: 14]: Parse error: expected '='"

This will display the Results page that shows the addition:  "Local Reset Extension Status: Updated the
local copy of the network password".
The user’s password has now been changed. With Local Reset Extension installed, their previously
cached password on the Windows W ork s t ation  will update to match the new password.
Use Case: Business Case for Local Reset Extension
This use case provides a situational  example that demonstrates the usefulness of the Local Reset
Extension.
1.Abbie brings their Windows W ork s t ation  laptop from home to the corporate office. 1.
2.When in the corporate office,  the laptop connects to the corporate network and can communicate 2.
with the Activ e  Directory domain.
3.Abbie logs into the Windows W ork s t ation  laptop with her current password A123 . 3.
4.The Windows W ork s t ation  authentic a t es  the password against the corporate Activ e  Directory domain 4.
since the laptop is connected to the corporate network.
5.Abbie is now signed into the laptop.5.
6.Abbie realizes that they need to change their password since it is about to expire.6.
7.Abbie opens a browser window and navigates to the company’s Bravura Pass  instance URL. 7.
8.Abbie logs in to the Front end (PSF) as abbiel with password A123 . 8.
9.Abbie changes her password to B456 . 9.10. Abbie’s password has now been changed. 10.
With Local Reset Extension installed, Abbie’s previously cached password on the Windows
W ork s t ation  updates to match the new password.
11. Abbie signs out of the Windows w ork s t ation  laptop at the end of the day. 11.
12. Abbie still has work to do, so brings their laptop home. 12.
13. Abbie’s laptop is no longer connected to the corporate network at home. 13.
14. Abbie logs in to the Windows w ork s t ation  laptop with the new password B456 . 14.
The Windows w ork s t ation  tries to authentic a t e  Abbie’s password against the corporate Activ e  Directory
domain, but since it is not connected to the corporate network, it cannot reach AD for authentic ation.
The Windows w ork s t ation  next tries to authentic a t e  Abbie against the stored Windows cache.
Since the Local Reset Extension updated that cache during the password change at work, the Windows
w ork s t ation  allows Abbie to log in.
Result if Local Reset Extension is not installed
When the Local Reset Extension is not installed, the Windows cache would have still been set to the old
password A123 . This would mean after  following the same steps in the Use Case, when Abbie attemp t ed
to log in using B456  at home, the Windows w ork s t ation  would have denied them entry. The laptop
would not be able to reach the AD domain for authentic ation  and would try to authentic a t e  against the
Windows cache. The cached password A123  would not match the attemp t ed  B456  password, so the
password authentic ation  would fail. Abbie might think to call the Help Desk at this point, but even if the
Help Desk performs a password reset, the laptop is not connected to the network domain and c ontinues
to attemp t  user authentic ation  against the outdated cache.
If Abbie remembered her old A123 password at home, then she would be able to log in to the laptop with
the old password since it would match the cached Windows password. However, due to complex
password policies, it is often  not the case that users remember their old password.Login Assistant: R esetting  passwords from a login prompt
Users may forget their initial  w ork s t ation  / network login passwords, or lock themselves out of their
w ork s t ation,  and therefore be unable to access their own web browsers. Login Assistant uses a secure
kiosk account (SKA); a specially constructed and locked down account, to provide users with secure
access to the Bravura Pass  password change interface from the login prompt on their w ork s t ations.
Login Assistant softw ar e
Login Assistant is composed of:
▪The secure kiosk account SKA, working with client softw ar e  (runurl ) ▪
▪ Cr edential  Provider extensions for Windows 8 and newer ▪
Methods of secure kiosk account implemen t ation
There are two main methods that you can use to implement a secure kiosk account (SKA):
▪Domain-level account▪
A domain-level secure kiosk account is a network login account de fined  in an Activ e  Directory domain.
It typically has a help  login ID. A security policy is applied to the help account that restricts access to
the oper ating  system and network resources when using the SKA.
▪ W ork s t ation-le v el  account ▪
A help account is de fined  on a user’s w ork s t ation  instead of in a network oper ating  system directory
such as a Windows domain. The account is added to the Log on Locally user rights assignment policy.
Users can then log into their w ork s t ations  with the local ID help . Logging into the account launches
the SKA.
Cr edential  Provider for Windows
Working with the help account, the Bravura Pass  Cr edential  Provider softw ar e  provides a Change my
password  tile on the Windows login screen.
Clicking the tile logs into the help account, which launches the SKA and allows users to change their
passwords and unlock their accounts using Bravura Pass . The Cr edential  Provider extension works with
both the local and domain-level help account.
If a user is locked out of their account because the password has expired, or an incorrect password has
been entered too many times,  they may want to change their password using Bravura Security Fabric .
The user can click Switch User  or Other Cr edentials  to access the Change my password  tile.Security c onsider ations  of in t egr ating  the Cr edential  Provider tile
When the user clicks on the tile or logs in with the help account, Login Assistant starts a web browser
with the help account’s limited permissions and security pr ofile.
Remote access
The Login Assistant client allows locked-out users to connect to the Internet over a WiFi hotspot or using
an AirCard. Locked-out users can also establish a temporary Internet c onnection  using their home
Internet c onnection  or a hotel Internet service.
When the Login Assistant is run, it can do an immediate check to see if it is connected to the Internet
using the external URL and expected data as specified  during ins t allation  (on page 1595). If connected,
then it immediately works the same as a regular Login Assistant.
If it cannot connect to the Internet, a prompt asks users to select how to connect, with these options:
▪Wired attemp t  another direct c onnection ▪
▪WiFi allow the user to select a WiFi network to connect through▪
▪AirCard use a wireless stick  if c on figur ed. ▪If WiFi is selected, the Login Assistant displays a list of detected networks, allowing the user to select one
and pot entially  enter a network key.
