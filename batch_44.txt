Batch and web notific ation
Applies to Bravura Pass license 
The Bravura Security Fabric  user notific ation  system allows you to:
▪Streamline Bravura Security Fabric  deployment and ensure c ontinued  security compliance ▪
▪ Notif y  users of pending password expiry ▪
▪ Notif y  users of other events ▪
▪Force users to comply with r egis tr ation  or other requirements ▪
About notific ations
There are two kinds of notific ation  events:
▪Batch notific ations  Are evaluated at certain times  of day, or as requested by  Bravura Security Fabric ▪
administrators. They are evaluated for all users, and those that meet the selection  criteria are usually
sent notific ation  via email.
▪Web notific ations  Are triggered when a single user does something, such as log into a w ork s t ation  or ▪
into Bravura Security Fabric .
The action  or event causes a c onnection  with the Notific ation  Service, which evaluates which
notific ations  apply to the user, and whether any action  needs to be taken. For example, a user logging
into his w ork s t ation  may have a reminder for a pending password expiry. The service could then cause
a browser to open for the user to log in and then show an in f ormational  page for the notific ation.
Web notific ations  can be c on figur ed  to force the user to take action  before allowing them to proceed.
In the example above, the service might log the user off if he closes his web browser without changing
his password.
To set up user notific ations:
1.Install the Notific ation  Client ( psntfclient ) (on page 436), if users will receive notific ation  via their 1.
web browser.
2.Add password expiry de t ection  (on page 443), if users will be notified  when their network password is 2.
about to expire.
3. Con figur e  web notific ations  (on page 448) or batch notific ations  (on page 459). 3.
You must have the "Manage notific ations"  adminis trative  privilege to be able to c onfigure  user
notific ations..
User notific ation  system components
The Bravura Security Fabric  user notific ation  system consists of four main binaries:Notific ation  Service Updates the database with in f ormation  about notific ation  events and compliance
rules, and runs plugins that:
▪Check if a user is in compliance for a particular  event ▪
▪Send reminders to non-compliant users, either by web or email▪
▪Take action  if the reminder limit for a user is exceeded ▪
▪Generate a list of non-compliant users for batch notific ation ▪
Notific ation  Client The Notific ation  Client ( psntfclient ) is required only if users will receive
notific ation  via their web browser. The client is installed on a network share and is
responsible for c on t acting  the Notific ation  Service ( psntfsvc ) to determine if users
have any pending notific ations.  If they do, the psntfclient program opens a
browser on the user’s w ork s t ation  for the user to fir s t log in and then to display the
notific ation  message in Bravura Security Fabric . If any of those notific ations  are force-
level, the psntfclient opens the browser in kiosk mode, pr e v enting  the user
from accessing na vig ation  or other functionality  until  the user becomes compliant.
User notific ations  (PSN)
moduleActs as the gateway between the Notific ation  Client ( psntfclient ) and the
Notific ation  Service, and enables users to receive, acknowledge, and act on
notific ations  from their web browser.
ntftrigger Bravura Security Fabric  uses the ntftrigger program to communicate with the
Notific ation  Service and send out notific ations.  Scheduling a batch notific ation  creates
a scheduled job to run ntftrigger . You can use this program to test notific ations
rather than wait for the scheduled time.
Configure  the Startup Programs on all PCs, using a GPO, to call the Bravura Security Notific ation  Client,
which will check if there are any messages to display to the user and, if so, launch their default web
browser to the appropriate URL. The notific ation  client need not be installed locally on PCs – it can be run
from a network share that is placed on the Intranet Zone to avoid security warnings.
Secondary servers and r eplic ation
Note the following in r elation  to secondary servers and r eplic ation:
▪Web and batch notific ations  are replicated to replica server s during auto discovery. ▪
▪You cannot add or c on figur e  notific ations  on a replica server , although you can schedule batch ▪
notific ations  on a replica server . All fields  on the Manage the system > Policies > User notific ations
pages, except for the batch notific ation  scheduling fields,  are read-only.
▪Batch notific ations  are run only on the server on which they are scheduled. The schedule is not ▪
replicated, to avoid duplicate notific ations.
▪User s t atistics  and user notific ation  data are updated r eal-time. ▪
Notific ation  Service (p sntfs v c)
Notific ation  Service ( psntfsvc ) is installed and started on the Bravura Security Fabric  server when you
install the Bravura Security Fabric  softw ar e.  You can modify default options  by clicking Manage the
system > Maintenance > Services , then selecting  the Notific ation  Service.User notific ations  (PSN)
The User notific ations  (PSN) module acts as the gateway between the Notific ation  Client ( psntfclient )
and the Notific ation  Service, and enables users to receive, acknowledge, and act on notific ations  from
their web browser
When a web notific ation  is triggered, the user is prompted to log into Bravura Security Fabric  and then
the web browser will open at the Notific ations  page of the User notific ations  (PSN) module. Users can also
access this page, if they have notific ations,  from a link on the main menu.
Enabling / disabling the User notific ations  (PSN) module 
The User notific ations  (PSN) module is enabled by default.
To disable the User notific ations  (PSN) module:
1.Click Manage the system  > Modules  > User notific ation . 1.
2.Turn off PSN ENABLED to disable the module. 2.
3.Click Update to commit your changes. 3.
Disabling the User notific ations  (PSN) module disables all web notific ations.  It does not aff ect  batch
notific ations.
Configuring  notific ation  events 
If you are using a web notific ation  to enforce compliance with an Acceptable use policy  (on page 449)
c on figur e  event options,  listed below, which trigger external programs. See Event actions  for more
in f ormation  about c on figuring  event actions.
User notific ations  (PSN) module events that launch interface programs
Option Description
AUP DONE A user accepts an acceptable use policy.
AUP NOT DONE A user declines an acceptable use policy.
Modify notific ations  and redirect users
You can use a plugin to modify the order of notific ations  and redirect users as they navigate and act on
notific ations.
When the User notific ations  (PSN) module is enabled and the plugin is set, and a user logs into Bravura
Security Fabric :1.The plugin presents a list of notific ations  in order of priority. 1.
2. After  the user acts on a notific ation  (clicks Accept or Decline ), the plugin directs the user to the next 2.
notific ation  in the list.
3.When there are no more notific ations  left, the user is directed to the Front-end . 3.
The plugin is set by the PSN MODIFY ORDER AND REDIRECTION PLUGIN field  (Manage the system >
Modules> User notific ations  (PSN) )
There are no shipped plugins for use with this plugin point. See more in f ormation  on writing  a custom
plugin
Requirements
The plugin must return notific ations  not only in order but without any gaps in numbers. If there are 5
notific ations  and you want to show them all, then they will have to be numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. If say they
were numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 then the last one will be hidden.
Notific ations  can be hidden by:
▪ Setting  their priorities  to "0" or any number behind the real sequence; for example if you have 10 ▪
notific ations:  1 through to 10, you can hide notific ations  by setting  the priority to 12, 100 or 9999.
▪Removing particular  KVGroups from output altogether. Ensure that you update priorities  of all ▪
notific ations  "behind" the deleted one.
See W riting  plugins  for general requirements.
Ex ecution  points
This plugin is executed once when a user logs into Bravura Security Fabric .

Output
The following is an example of the possible output, where "AUP2" is hidden:
# KVGROUP-V1.0
  "" "" = {
  retval = "0"
    "notification" "1" = {
      "id" = "AUP1"

Notific ation  Client (p sntfclien t)
Client softw ar e  is required only if users will be notified  via their web browser. For Windows clients,
Bravura Security provides ntfclient.msi , or ntfclient-x64.msi  for 64-bit systemslocated in
the \<instance>\addon\  directory. For Unix/MacOSX clients, you can write a Perl script based on
ntfclient.pl , located in the \<instance>\samples\  directory.Requirements
▪ Micr osoft  Edge WebView2 Runtime  must be installed with elevated privileges prior to installing with ▪
psntfclient-x64.msi or psntfclient.msi.
If it is not installed or it is not installed with elevated privileges, you will see a message such as this
when opening the notific ation  client: Runtime error: Couldn't find WebView2
runtime, it should be installed as admin.
To install with elevated privileges, either open a command prompt using the Run as administrator
option  for cmd.exe or right click on the installer and click Run as administrator , then install Micr osoft
Edge WebView2 Runtime.
The installer simply copies the psntfclient program to the file system. It does not c onfigure  the
client to launch. It is recommended that you install the client on network share, and set up a GPO
(Group Policy Object) to launch the client upon user login to their work s t ation  with a command such as
psntfclient.exe -userid %USERNAME% .
There are two ways that the p sntfclien t  can be deployed:
▪Run the ntfclient  MSI installer on every w ork s t ation. ▪
▪Place the psntfclient.exe  and webbrowser.dll  on a file share. ▪
Steps
To manually install the Notific ation  Client for Windows using the ntfclient.msi or nftclient-
x64.msi :
1.Copy the installer from the addon directory to a scratch directory (C: \temp) on the local w ork s t ation 1.
or to a publicly accessible share.
2.Launch the installer.2.
Click Next .3.Read the Bravura Security Fabric  license. Select I accept the terms in the License Agreement if you 3.

5.Set the URL for the User notific ations  (PSN) module on the Bravura Security Fabric  server, and the 5.
Timeout in minutes.
Click Next .
6.Click Install to start the ins t allation. 6.The installer begins copying files to your computer. The Ins t allation  Complete dialog appears after  the
notific ation  client has been successfully installed.
7.Click Finish to exit. 7.

The Notific ation  Client ( psntfclient ) is required only if users will receive notific ation  via their web
browser. The client is installed on a network share and is responsible for c on t acting  the Notific ation
Service ( psntfsvc ) to determine if users have any pending notific ations.  If they do, the
psntfclient program opens a browser on the user’s w ork s t ation  for the user to fir s t log in and
then to display the notific ation  message in Bravura Security Fabric . If any of those notific ations  are
force-level, the psntfclient opens the browser in kiosk mode, pr e v enting  the user from
accessing na vig ation  or other functionality  until  the user becomes compliant.
Use the ntfclient.msi from the addon directory to install the Notific ation  Client
(psntfclient ). It is recommended that you install and run the client from a shared folder and
include it in a login script.
Requirement
The psntfsvc service  (on page 2835) must be installed and started on the Bravura Security Fabric
server.
The psntfclient program is intended to be run from a public share. The webbrowser.dll ,
which is used to open a browser to the User notific ations  (PSN) module if notific ations  exist, must also
be located in the same share.
Bravura Security recommends that the Notific ation  Client communicates with the Bravura Security
Fabric  server using SSL (HTTPS).
Ins t allation
The Notific ation  Client can be installed by launching the MSI manually or aut omatic ally  using a group
policy.
Usage
psntfclient -userid <user ID>[-url http[s]://<server>[:<port>]/
<path>/cgi/psn.exe ] [-targetid <target ID> ] [-width <width> -
height <height>] [-skin <skinID>] [-lang <lang-locale>]Option  / Argument Description
-userid <userid> Use %USERNAME% to use the currently logged in user, or
specify a user ID.
-url <URL> The path to the User notific ations  (psn) module on the
Bravura Security Fabric  server. If used, this value
overrides the URL set during ins t allation.
-t ar g etid  <target ID> Specify a target system if the user ID is not a Bravura
Security Fabric  pr ofile  ID. The url can optionally  specify a
port and security.
-width <width> Specify the notific ation  window width.
-height <height> Specify the notific ation  window height.
-skin <skinID> Specify a skin ID. If used, this value overrides the one that
is specified  for the user in the LASTSKIN tag in the
userstat table.
-lang <lang-locale> Specify a language code for the language-locale. If used,
this value overrides the one that is specified  for the user
in the LASTLANG tag in the userstat table.
The Notific ation  Client has a minimum width and height of 913 x 338 pixels. If the specified  -width or -
height is less than the minimum required dimensions, or if there are any force-type notific ations,  then
the browser opens at 913 x 338 pixels.
