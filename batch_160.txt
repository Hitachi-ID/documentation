A Hidden Network...  button  allows the user to specify an SSID and password for a hidden wifi
c onnection.
If AirCard is selected, the Login Assistant will display the third party applic ation.  Once the user has
connected the applic ation  will disappear.
What happens when users log in
When users are on the log in page of their w ork s t ations  and use the Login Assistant, the runurl
program is executed. If you are using the domain-level secure kiosk account, this program may berunning from a shared volume or public network share (typically on the Bravura Pass  server, or each
logon server’s netlogon or sysvol share).
If you are using a local secure kiosk account, this program is loaded from the local w ork s t ation.
The runurl  program locks down w ork s t ations  by in t er cepting  certain input event types (keyboard,
mouse), and starts a web browser in kiosk mode with the appropriate URL. Bravura Pass  determines
from the URL that the incoming request is for a secure kiosk account (SKA) and displays a special, locked-
down skin. Users then authentic a t e  to Bravura Pass  using security questions  or some other
authentic ation  method to change their f or g otten  passwords.
When the Login Assistant is launched, the login ID of the domain user that is currently logged into
Windows is aut omatic ally  passed to the URL so that the domain user does not need to retype it in the
Login Assistant. The login ID is passed to the URL when any of the following occurs:
▪The user changes their password by pressing [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Del]  and then clicking Change a Password . ▪
▪The w ork s t ation  is locked and the user enters an invalid password to log back into Windows, then ▪
clicks OK to change the password using Bravura Pass .
▪The user attemp ts  to log into their account when it is locked, then clicks OK to unlock the account ▪
using Bravura Pass .
▪The domain user’s password is soon to expire or already expired, and the user enters the correct▪
password to log in to Windows and clicks OK to change the password.
The soon-to-expire, expired, account-locked and password-change cases are not supported by the
Credential  Provider.
Access to self-service password reset should be available at the work s t ation  login screen, which means
deploying Login Assistant to all work s t ations.  If signific an t  numbers of users work off -sit e  and sign into
their work s t ation  with cached AD domain credentials,  then integrate Login Assistant with the
corporate VPN, to enable password reset and update of cached credentials  when off -sit e.  This process
is further described in Self-Service Anywhere (SSA) for remote users.
SSA also includes the ins t allation  of the Local Rest Extension, which allows Login Assistant to trigger
updates to locally cached passwords after  a successful password reset.
Since Login Assistant is most often  used for f or g otten  passwords, a secure and easy-to-use second
authentic ation  method  (on page 1626) should be c on figur ed  for Login Assistant users that does not
include password authentic ation.  An example of multi- f act or  authentic ation  to use for Login Assistant
users, would be requiring users to answer their security questions  followed by QR code v erific ation  using
the mobile Bravura One  app.
User experience
When using the Login Assistant on a corporate network for a f or g otten  password, the user experiences
the following:
▪User:  opens their w ork s t ation  to the user log in screen. ▪▪User:  triggers the Login Assistant by clicking an available "f or g otten  password" tile or link on the user ▪
log in screen.
▪Login server:  opens a web browser for the user with the appropriate Bravura Pass  applic ation  URL. ▪
▪User:  authentic a t es  to Bravura Pass  using the c on figur ed  multi- f act or  authentic ation,  such as security ▪
questions  and QR code v erific ation  through the mobile Bravura One  app.
▪User:  clicks Change Passwords  on their self-service Bravura Pass  home page. ▪
▪User:  successfully changes their password. ▪
▪Bravura Pass : synchronizes the new password with the corporate domain and any other accounts ▪
attached  to the user’s Bravura Pass  pr ofile.
▪User:  closes the web browser and is returned to the user log in screen. ▪
▪User:  logs in to their w ork s t ation  using the new password. Since the w ork s t ation  is connected to the ▪
corporate network, the w ork s t ation  v erifies  the new password against their corporate domain
password and successfully grants the user access. The locally cached Windows w ork s t ation  password
is updated aut omatic ally  when the user successfully logs in to the w ork s t ation.
Enabling password changes from a login prompt
The following two sections  provide an overview of steps required to enable password changes from a
login prompt using Bravura Pass  and either a domain-level secure kiosk account, or w ork s t ation  secure
kiosk account.
Domain-level secure kiosk account
To implement password changes from a login prompt using a domain-level SKA:
1.Create the domain help user  (on page 1611). 1.
2.Remove the help account from the Bravura Security Fabric  account list, to prevent users from 2.
changing the help account password or attaching  the ID.
3. Optional:  Install Login Assistant softw ar e  (on page 1595) on users’ w ork s t ations  to allow them to 3.
access the domain help account.
Alt ernativ ely ,  if you do not want to install softw ar e  on users’ w ork s t ations,  carry out steps outlined in
Setting  up on a Domain (No W ork s t ation  Softw ar e)  (on page 1611) and educate users to use the help
account manually.
W ork s t ation  secure kiosk account
▪To implement password changes from a login prompt using a w ork s t ation-le v el  SKA, use the installer ▪
for Windows to create the help account and install the required Login Assistant softw ar e  on users’
w ork s t ations.
See:
▪Installing Login Assistant Softw ar e  on W ork s t ations  (on page 1595) for details about installing the ▪
softw ar e.
▪ Setting  up Login Assistant for Remote Users  (on page 1628) for a common use-case. ▪Best pr actice
Con figur e  a special VPN account with a s t atic  password, which Login Assistant will use to connect to the
network and update locally-cached passwords when users are off -sit e.
Presuming that the VPN service you use is capable of this, apply the following limits to this account on
the VPN server side:
1.Create a new, dedicated read-only AD domain controller (DC).1.
2. Con figur e  Bravura Pass  to always push new AD password resets to this DC along with any others. 2.
along with any others. along with any others.
3. Con figur e  the VPN user to only be able to access: 3.
a.The IP of this DC (all TCP ports).a.
b.The HTTPS URL of Bravura Pass  – typically via a load balancer. b.
4.Set a c onnection  timeout  on the VPN user to 10 minutes. 4.
5.Disable intruder lockouts on the VPN user, to minimize the pot ential  for a denial-of-service attack  on 5.
user access to self-service.
Notes on usage
Local password cache
When the Bravura Pass local reset extension  (on page 1578) client tool is not installed, a user must
manually log out of Windows and then log back in to reset his locally cached password after  he uses the
SKA to change his password within Windows by pressing [Ctrl]+[ALT]+[Delete]  and then clicking Change
password .
If a user uses the SKA to change his password, and the Bravura Pass  local reset extension
(pslocalr.ocx ) client tool is installed, then he is not required to log out of Windows and then log
back in.Login Assistant: Installing softw ar e  on w ork s t ations
This chapter shows you how to install the Login Assistant client softw ar e  and set up the help account on
local w ork s t ations.  Before you start, read R esetting  passwords from a login prompt  (on page 1587).
Bravura Pass  provides installer packages, to create the help account and install the required softw ar e  on
users’ w ork s t ations,  for Windows client w ork s t ations  version 7 and newer ( ska.msi , or ska-x64.msi
for 64-bit systems)
You cannot install Login Assistant on a Domain Controller. The installer will abort safely if a DC is
detected.
Windows
The installer package can be executed on the following client oper ating  systems:
▪Windows 11 (64-bit)▪
▪Windows 10 (32-bit or 64-bit)▪
▪Windows 8.1 (32-bit or 64-bit)▪
▪Windows 8 (32-bit or 64-bit)▪
Requirements
▪In order to create the help accounts and install the softw ar e  on Windows w ork s t ations,  you must ▪
launch the appropriate Windows Installer package using elevated privileges.
If you need to launch the Windows Installer package from an account without the necessary elevated
privileges, you can specify a privileged adminis trative  account to perform the ins t allation  using the
ADMIN_USERNAME and ADMIN_PASSWORD ins t allation  options.
▪Ensure that the CleanupPolicy GPO ("Delete user pr ofiles  older than a specified  number of days on ▪
system restart") is disabled before installing Login Assistant. This policy is inc ompatible  with the use of
the secure kiosk account.
▪If users must use a domain help account, rather than a local w ork s t ation  account, ensure that you set ▪
up the domain-level secure kiosk account according to requirements  (on page 1593) outlined earlier.
Before ins t allation  on a Windows work s t ation,  you must assign the "SeBackupPrivilege" to the
Windows Installer service.
On a Windows 7 or Vista work s t ation,  execute MsiServerCfg.vbs from the command line under
adminis trative  privileges. The script is located in the addon\login assistant\win\ directory.
Alt ernatively ,  install the following Microsoft  hotfix:
http:// support.microsoft.c om/kb/2514642
If "SeBackupPrivilege" is not assigned, the installer provides the warning message: "Failed to load
profile  for user help: A required privilege is not held by the client."
▪If you are using a Cisco anyConnect VPN c onnection,  there are additional  settings  that can only be set ▪
by running the MSI on the command line. See Command-line Cisco anyConnect VPNIf you are using a Cisco anyConnect VPN c onnection,  the following additional  settings  that can only be
set by running the msi on the command line:
VPN_CONNECT_STDINPUT  is a [~]  separated list of lines that go to standard input. The value is
written  as a registry entry with multi-s tring  value called vpn-connect-stdinput . It does not
allow for empty lines as the registry value type does not either.
Run vpncli.exe  manually and in t er activ ely  to determine what input is needed. Input lines will
replace % USERID%  with the VPN userid and %PASSWORD%  with the VPN password; for example:
▪<vpn profile> ▪
▪%USERID%▪
▪%PASSWORD%▪
▪y▪
The <vpn profile>  should be replaced with VPN connect pr ofile,  and the y is to accept VPN terms of
use. This translates into the following MSI command line parameter:
VPN_CONNECT_STDINPUT="profile[~]%USERID%[~]%PASSWORD%[~]y"
VPN_CONNECT_TERMINATE  is to optionally  terminate any running programs before trying to launch
the VPN client, as Cisco anyConnect will fail if vpncli.exe  or vpnui.exe  are running. The value is
written  as a registry entry called vpn-connect-terminate . This is optional  but recommended.
The value is a comma-separated list of process names; for example:
VPN_CONNECT_TERMINATE="vpncli.exe,vpnui.exe"
VPN_HIDE_WINDOW  is used to hide the pop-up console window that vpncli.exe  starts. This is
written  as a registry entry called vpn-hide-window . By default, it is off , as the showing of the
console window is the default behavior and is required for some VPN clients. To disable set:
VPN_HIDE_WINDOW = 1
For other SKA installer command-line options,  see Add-on ins t allation  command-line options  (on page
245).
