Loading attribut es
During auto discovery , Bravura Security Fabric  loads a list of users’ accounts on target systems into its
internal database. By default, Bravura Security Fabric  also loads the most commonly used account
attribut es,  including users’ fir s t names, last names, email addresses, and OrgChart managers.
You can c on figur e  Bravura Security Fabric  to load account attribut es  at the target type or target override
levels. To do this:
1.Navigate to the override c on figur ation  page. 1.
2.Enable the Load attribut e  values from target system checkbox. 2.
3.Click Update . 3.
Attribut es  must be listed before they can be loaded. If the List accounts and List attribut es  options  are
not enabled for a target system  (on page 480), you must provide a list.
If you want users to be able to view or edit the attribut e  value, map the account attribut e  to a pr ofile  and
request attribut e  (on page 571). The Load attribut e  values from a target system option  is aut omatic ally
set when you map to a pr ofile  and request attribut e.
Mapping an account attribut e  to a profile  and request attribut e  will enable a user to edit the attribut e
value, and the value will be updated on the target system. However, only the values from the most
commonly used account attribut es  are loaded from the target system back to Bravura Security Fabric.
Mapping account attribut es  to pr ofile  and request attribut es
Pr ofile  and request attribut es  allow any number of account attribut es  to be mapped to a single value in
users’ pr ofile  data. Several attribut es  are mapped by default; for example, the Activ e  Directory mail
and Lotus Domino Server InternetAddress  account attribut es  are mapped to the EMAIL pr ofile  and
request attribut e.  Attribut es  that are mapped to pr ofile  and request attribut es  are listed by default when
the target system’s List attribut es  setting  is enabled.
In order to map an account attribut e  to a profile  and request attribut e,  the attribut es’  requirements
(number of values, attribut e  type, encoding) must be c ompatible.
If a profile  attribut e  is set to not display in reports, the mapped account attribut e  will also not display in
reports.
To map an account attribut e  to a pr ofile  and request attribut e:
1.Select an override level  (on page 569). 1.
2.Select an account attribut e. 2.
3.Choose the pr ofile  and request attribut e  to map to. You can either: 3.
▪Search for the pr ofile  and request attribut e ▪
▪Type the pr ofile  and request attribut e  ID in the Map account attribut e  to pr ofile/r eques t  attribut e ▪
field
▪Create a new pr ofile  and request attribut e: ▪
i.Click the search icon 
 . i.ii.Click 
  Add new ... ii.
iii. Con figur e  the options  de fined  in Getting  started  (on page 1269). iii.
iv.Close the pr ofile  and request attribut e  attribut e  in f ormation  pop-up window. iv.
The Populate mapped pr ofile  attribut e  with values from target system will aut omatic ally  be
selected when the Map account attribut e  to pr ofile  and request attribut e  field  is filled  in and
when the Load attribut e  values from target system has been checked. You can disable the
mapping of attribut es  by deselecting  this box.
4.Click Update . 4.
Mapping target system boolean attribut e  values
Pr ofile  and resource attribut es  in Bravura Security Fabric  represent boolean values internally using T and
F for true and false, r espectiv ely .  However, target systems may use values other than T and F to
represent boolean attribut e  values. Use the c on figur ation  settings  Target system attribut e  value that
represents [True]  and Target system attribut e  value that represents [False]  to ensure that target system
boolean attribut e  values are converted correctly to mapped pr ofile  or resource attribut es.  For example, if
a target system attribut e  uses 1 for true and 0 for false, then set Target system attribut e  value that
represents [True]  to 1 and Target system attribut e  value that represents [False]  to 0.
Specifying attribut e  values
Specifying fix ed  values will apply to account cr eation  and update.
The steps to specify attribut e  values for the "set” action,  when not mapping them to pr ofile  and request
attribut es,  vary according to the attribut e  type:
Values set for Map account attribut e  to profile/reques t  attribut e  will override specified  values.
To specify a character or number value for an account attribut e:
1.Navigate to the override c on figur ation  page. 1.
2.Set the Value type to Literal value or PSLang expression as appropriate. 2.
3.Type a value in the field  under the Attribut e  value header. 3.
For boolean type values, select True, False, or Unset from the drop-down list in the Attribut e  value
column.
For PSLang, you can select an available expression from the aut o-c ompletion  list.
4.Click Update . 4.
If more than one value is allowed by the Maximum number of values , Bravura Security Fabric  adds
more fields  below the one you just entered.
5.If applicable, add more values, and click Update . 5.
Tracking account attribut e  changes
Changes to account attribut e  values can be tracked. The tracked changes are viewable as part of each
user’s pr ofile  history  (on page 560). You can also c on figur e  the idtrack program to executeprovisioning actions  based on the changes. To c on figur e  Bravura Security Fabric  to track account attribut e
changes:
1.Navigate to the override c on figur ation  page. 1.
2.Select the Track changes option. 2.
3.Click Update . 3.
Deleting  specified  attribut e  values
To delete an attribut e  value that you have specified:
1.Navigate to the override c on figur ation  page. 1.
2.Select the checkboxes next to the values you want to delete.2.
3.Click Delete at the bottom  of the ”values” form. 3.
Con firming  and t esting  changes
After  you have made changes on the override c on figur ation  page:
1.If required, c on firm  your changes. Click: 1.
▪Yes (recommended), if you want to reload attribut e  values during the next auto discovery . ▪
In this case, Bravura Security Fabric  updates the SQLite-based list files that correspond to the
a ff ect ed  target systems (for example, WINDOWS1.db) with a full attribut e  list.
▪No, if you want to reload attribut e  values only when the attribut e  changes on the target system. ▪
This may help to speed up auto discovery ; however, it may also result in empty or out-of-date
attribut es  in the Bravura Security Fabric  database.
2.Click Back to return to the Account attribut es  page. 2.
The attribut e  now appears in one of the level overrides tabs.
3.If required, run auto discovery  to update your system. 3.
4.Test your changes.4.
Ensure that attribut e  in f ormation  can be listed (if applicable), and that accounts can be created,
updated, and deleted successfully.
Adding account attribut es
If the attribut e  you want to utiliz e  is not included in the “catalog” of shipped attribut es  you can add the
attribut e  manually. This way, the attribut e  will be loaded into Bravura Security Fabric  ’s internal database.
After  you have added the attribut e  you can then manage the attribut e  the same way default attribut es
can be managed.
You can also use this step to add account attribut es  for custom applic ations  or systems with modifiable
schemas. Adding an account attribut e  allows you to override the default action.
To add an account attribut e:
1.Select an override level  (on page 569). 1.2.Click Add new... at the bottom  of the Account attribut es  page. 2.
Bravura Security Fabric  displays the c on figur ation  page.
3.Type a descriptiv e  value in the Attribut e  name field. 3.
4.If required, override the default settings.  See: 4.

5.Click Add. 5.
Deleting  overrides and non-shipped attribut es
To undo the changes you have made to a shipped account attribut e  and return it to its default setting ,  or
to remove an attribut e  that was not shipped with Bravura Security Fabric  :
1.Select an override level  (on page 569), then select the attribut e. 1.
2.Click Delete at the bottom  of the form. If required c on firm  your actions. 2.
Bravura Security Fabric  displays a c on firmation  page and asks you whether you want to:
▪Reload all attribut e  values during the next auto discovery – click Yes (recommended). ▪
In this case, Bravura Security Fabric  updates the SQLite-based list files that correspond to the
a ff ect ed  target systems; for example, WINDOWS1.db, with a full attribut e  list.
▪Reload attribut e  values only when the attribut e  changes on the target system – click No. ▪
This may help to speed up auto discovery ; however, it may also result in empty or out-of-date
attribut es  in the Bravura Security Fabric  database.
If the attribut e  was shipped with Bravura Security Fabric , the overrides for the current level are removed,
and the attribut e  is re-listed under the Defaults tab. If the attribut e  was not shipped with Bravura
Security Fabric , it is deleted from the system.Network resources
Bravura Group  provides a simple web interface that enables users to manage access to network
resources without the need to understand the underlying security infrastructure.
Bravura Group  manages diff er en t  types of resources using connectors and programs shipped with
Connector Pack  in the agent directory:
▪The nrsmb program binds managed group to a specific  resource whose access is mediated by ▪
membership in a group on a Legacy Activ e  Directory target system. These resources include shares,
folders, printers, and mail dis tribution  lists.
▪The nrcifs program binds managed group to a specific  resource whose access is mediated by ▪
membership in a group on an Activ e  Directory DN target system. These resources include shares,
folders, printers, and mail dis tribution  lists.
▪The nrshrpt program binds managed group to a specific  resource managed by a SharePoint ▪
Resource target system. SharePoint resources include sites and documents.
Bravura Group  requires network resource management plugins to:
▪List network resources▪
▪List permissions for each network resource▪
▪List the owners of a network resource▪
▪Add or delete owners for a network resource▪
▪List the ACLs on a directory or share▪
This chapter describes how to add network resources to managed groups , and how to add filt er  rules
that limit the groups that users can view and for which they can submit requests to modify group
membership.

options  related to network resource management; including w orkflo w  options,  event triggers, and
group owner selection.
Getting  started
Requirements
Before you begin, ensure that you have c on figur ed  managed group . See Setting  up network resource
management  (on page 2482) for more in f ormation.
Na vig ation  steps
You use the Network resource in f ormation  page to c on figur e  resource settings.  To navigate to this page:1.Click Manage the system > Resources > Network resources . 1.
2.If required, select the Resources sub-menu item. 2.
3.To de fine  a(n): 3.
▪New resource – if Bravura Security Fabric  displays a list of e xisting  resources, click Add new... . ▪
▪ Existing  resource – search for, or select the resource you want to view or modify. ▪
You use the Network resource filt ers  page to add filt er  rules  (on page 577). To navigate to this page, Click
Manage the system > Resources > Network resources  then select the Filters sub-menu item. At least one
network resource must exist before network resource filt er s  can be c on figur ed.
Adding network resources
To add a network resource that can be managed by managed group :
1.Navigate to the Network resource in f ormation  page  (on page 575), Network resource in f ormation 1.
page  (on page 842), Network resource in f ormation  page  (on page 2032).
2.Set the network resource options  as described in the table below. 2.
3.Click Add. 3.
Option Description
ID A unique identifier  for the resource.
Description The resource name that is displayed to users.
Type The resource type options  available depend on network resource
management plugin settings  on the Target system inf ormation  page.

▪Shares/Folders▪
▪Printers▪
▪Mail dis tribution  lists ▪
SMB Protocol for Activ e  Directory DN ( nrcifs ):
▪Shares/Folders▪
▪Printers▪
▪Mail dis tribution  lists ▪
SharePoint Resource ( nrshrpt ):
▪Sites▪
▪Documents▪Option Description
UNC path/URL (Shares/Folders only) The path to the network share that you want to
manage; for example, \\<servername>\<sharename>.
Alternately, you can use <IPAddress> instead of <servername>.
(Sites or Documents only) The URL to the SharePoint server that you want
to manage; for example, http://sharepoint1:2427/sitename.
Target system of the
resourceThe target system that mediates access to there source.
Users can only see sub-
resources if they have
rights to the resource(Shares/Folders or Sites only) Click this checkbox if you want to limit users
who can view subfolders to those who belong to a group that can view
the parent folder.
For resources aut omatic ally  created by the Shell Extension , this is
controlled by the IDR NETWORK RESOURCE VALIDATE setting..
Once resources are set up, resources are available to users via the Request access to network resources
link in the self-service menu.
Filtering network resource groups
You can limit the groups that Bravura Group  users can view, and for which they can request group
membership modific ations,  by:
▪Adding network resource filt er  rules using the Manage the system  (PSA) module  (on page 577) ▪
▪Using a resource group filt er  plugin  (on page 581) ▪
Filter rules
Filter rules can be applied to all network resources, a specific  target system, or a specific  resource.
managed group passes the applicable rules to the network resource plugin, which is responsible for
implementing  them. In the case of nrsmb and nrcifs , these rules are used to pr eemptiv ely  filt er  the
list of groups that it returns from the target system.
To add a group filt er  rule:
1.Click Manage the system > Resources > Network resources then select the Filters sub-menu item 1.
2.Type a regular expression P attern  that represents the groups that you want to filt er . 2.
See Using Regular Expressions
Regular expressions provide a way to identif y  patterns  of text in strings.
Bravura Security Fabric  uses regular expressions to:
▪Match and block invalid passwords.▪
▪ Identif y  users who it should not manage. ▪
▪Extract text from Telnet/TN3270 screens in Telnet connector scripts.▪
▪Extract text from the output of password hashing programs in DBMS connector scripts.▪Regular expressions use a shorthand of literal characters and special characters to de fine  a pattern  in a
precise and compact way. Literal characters are case sensitiv e.  The regular expression parser used by
Bravura Security Fabric  uses the following special characters in literal strings:
Character Purpose Example Match
. Matches any single
charactera.c aac , abc , a1c , a2c
^ Beginning of a line ^hat hat , hatch , not
chat
$ End of a line hat$ hat , chat , not
hatch
| Alt ernation job|task job or task
( ) Grouping job(12 |34) job12 or job34
\ Treat the following
special character
literally\$5\.6\\7 $5.6\7
The | alternates the longest possible string. That is, it matches job or task , and matches both
jotask and jobask .
Grouping with ( ) limits the alternate branches.
Character sets
Character sets
You can de fine  a set of characters within a string. Character sets match any single character enclosed
in square brackets [ ] . For example:
Expression Match
j[oa]n jon or jan
Use the - character between two characters in a set to indicate a range. A - character outside of a
set, or at the beginning or end of a set, is treated literally. For example:
Expression Match
[a-c] a, b, or c
[1-3] 1, 2, or 3
[ab-] a, b, or -
[B-D]-3 B-3 , C-3 , or D-3
If the fir s t character in the set is ^, then the character set matches any character that is not in the list.
For example:
Expression Match
[^oa] Any character except o and aAll other special characters lose their meaning when included in a character set. For example:
Expression Match
^[^*\+.-] Line must not start with *, \, +, .,or -
To include a literal ] in the character set, make it the fir s t character in the set. It can also be excluded
by following ^. The ] character is also treated literally outside of a set. For example:
Expression Match
[^]a-] Any character besides ], a, and -
[]a] ] or a
[a]] a]
Quantifier s
Quantifier s
You can specify quantities  of character sets, grouped characters, or individual characters. The
quantifier s  *, +, ?, and { } act on the preceding set, group, or individual character.
Character Purpose Example Match
* Specifies  0 or more
c onsecutiv e  occurrencesab*c ac, abc , abbbbc
+ Specifies  1 or more
c onsecutiv e  occurrencesab+c abc , abbbbc
? Specifies  0 or 1 occurrence colou?r (wo)?man color or colour
woman or man
{x} Exactly <x> occurrences ab{4}c abbbbc
{x,y} At least <x>, no more than
<y> occurrencesab{2,4}c abbc , abbbc , abbbbc
{x,} At least <x> occurrences ab{2,}c abbc , abbbc
{,x} No more than <x>
occurrencesab{,2}c ac, abc , or abbc
Shorthand expressions
Shorthand expressions
The following expressions are shorthand for longer or more complex regular expressions:
Expression Purpose Example Match
[:alpha:] Matches must consist of
letter s.[:alpha:]8,16 aBcmGLeEhhi[:digit:] Matches must consist of
digits. [:digit:] is equivalent
to [:d:] and \d.[[:digit:]]+ 2962954576
[:upper:] Matches must consist of
uppercase characters.[[:upper:]
[:digit:]]+9DDD4MLAG13
[:alnum:] Matches must be
alphanumeric. [:alnum:] is
short hand for [a-zA-Z0-9]
in the ascii character set,
but the use of [:alnum:] is
preferred for c ompatibility
with other languages and
character sets.[:alnum:]7[^[:digit:]] a3dM9DD+
Examples
Examples
Only allow letter s,  numbers, e x clamation  point, and
period^[a-zA-Z0-9!.] ⋆$
At most 8 characters long ^.,8$
Must start with a letter ^[a-zA-Z]
Must have a number [0-9]
Must end in -admin or -test (-admin |-test)$
Must begin with three capital letter s  and an underscore ^[A-Z] {3}_

For nrsmb and ntcifs , filt er s  are based on the distinguished  names (dn) of the groups.
3.Select the appropriate value from the Include/Exclude drop-down list: 3.
▪Exclude – if you select this value, none of the groups matching P attern  will be displayed in managed ▪
group .
▪Include – if you select this value, only the groups that match P attern , or that are included by ▪
another rule, will be displayed in managed group .
For nrsmb and ntcifs , include rules have precedence over exclude rules.
