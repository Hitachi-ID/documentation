Viewing attribut es  passed into Activ eX  plugins
To view the attribut es  passed into the Activ eX  control for debugging purposes, copy the logutil
program onto the system and run it, specifying the instance "PPMClient ActiveX Controls" .
You may need to generate an instance key to get logutil to capture Activ eX  logs. Ensure the system
initializing  the Activ eX  control does not have IE ESC turned on. See logutil usage details
Requirements
You must run the logutil  command as an administrator with sufficien t  privileges.
Usage
logutil.e x e  [options]  -instance <instance> | -cleanup [-instance <instance> ]
Argument Description
-bufmax <count> Maximum number of buff er s.  The default value is the
Windows Events MinimumBuff er s  + 20.
-bufmin <count> Minimum number of buff er s.  The default value is the
number of CPUs + 2.
-bufsize <size> Size of the session buff er s  in multiples  of 4 kb. The
default is 64 kb.
-instance <instance> Instance to watch events for. For Bravura Privilege local
service mode instances, the value is "Privileged Access
Manager Client".
-cleanup Terminate any logging sessions which are not connected
to any activ e  client. If the instance name is specified,  only
the logging session for this particular  instance is cleaned
up.
-level <level> Debug level 1-5. Default is 5.
-list List all enabled Event Tracing for Windows sessions.
-logfile  <filename> File to write events to. You must specify an absolute path.Argument Description
-makekey Generate an instance name and its log GUID in the
registry.
Note:  This option  needs to be run once only.
-maxdelay <maxdelay> The maximum seconds to allow the sorting  buff er  to keep
items before flushing  out into the log file. The default
value is 300.
-maxsorted <count> The maximum number of events that can be sorted in
memory. The default value is 100,000.
-outdbg Write events with an output debug string.
When logutil  runs, a new registry entry is created to record the session. The entry is stored under:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\<instance>\LogSession
The name of the entry is the instance name. When you press [enter]  to stop a session, the key will be
gone with the session; however, if you kill the session by typing [Ctrl] +[C], the registry entry will remain.
Use the -cleanup option  to remove remaining registry entries.
Note that various tools also have hardcoded instance names:
▪browser-extension-win: "Browser Extension" ▪
▪ fir e f o x -br o w ser -e xt ension:  "Firefox Browser Extension" ▪
▪hidshext: "Shell Extension" ▪
▪hipamlws-win: "Hipamlws" ▪

You must run logutil with the -makekey argument firs t for the instance "PPM Client ActiveX
Controls".

Use a plugin to de fine  access disclosure plugins
You can use a plugin to determine which access disclosure plugins, and with what settings,  will be
available to a recipient when attempting  to access a managed password. The recipient may be a product
administrator  with permissions to access a managed password, or a user with an approved request to
access a managed password.
The PSW disclosure plugin is particularly  useful when deciding what disclosure plugins should be given to
which users, in scenarios where the policy -de fined  plugins have a c on flict  based on the managed system
policy c on figur ation.  It is also useful to c on figur e  which disclosure plugins users can have access to based
on various other attribut es  and values.
To use a PSW disclosure plugin:
1.Click Manage the system  > Modules  > Privileged access . 1.
2.Type the name of the plugin in the PSW DISCLOSURE PLUGIN field. 2.
By default, the following in f ormation  is passed into the plugin:
▪Current manually c on figur ed  disclosure plugins for the requested account or group set (based off of ▪
c on figur ed  disclosure plugins for the managed system policies)
▪Managed account in f ormation  (what account on which system, and which managed system policy ▪
settings  its being checked out with)
▪Request ID▪
▪Requested plugin in f ormation  (only available when users check out passwords using a URL) ▪
▪Recipient of the request▪
Some data is not input by default. You must manually enable certain registry settings  to allow the plugin
to receive this in f ormation.
Ensure that you are comfortable and knowledgeable in the mechanics of the registry before you attemp t
to change any c onfiguration  settings.  Contact support@bravurasecurity.com  if in doubt.
See details on registry settings  to control data to disclosure pluginsTo enable additional  PSW DISCLOSURE PLUGIN  input, set these entries in the following key:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\<instance>\idarch
▪default plugin attribut es ▪

account is on.
Entry name  plugin_p s w_disclosur e_f ound_c omp_m v_attr s
Value  0—1

.There is a sample PSW disclosure plugin, psw-disclosure-plugin.psl , available in the samples
directory. By default it displays no controls. You must initially  disable built-in controls before plugin-
de fined  controls are available.
