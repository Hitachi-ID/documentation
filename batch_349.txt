Determining language preference
Bravura Security Fabric  determines each user’s preferred language in the following ways:
▪A value specified  in the Bravura Security Fabric  URL ▪
▪The user’s browser preference▪
▪Using the language selector in Bravura Security Fabric ▪
Including language preference in the URL
If the URL used to access Bravura Security Fabric  includes the <lang>-<locale> code in its path after  the
instance name, then Bravura Security Fabric  loads the skin for the specified  language.
For example, for Spanish enter the URL:
http s://idm-ser v er/de f ault/ es-es
As the user navigates through the interfaces, the path is appended to the URL, for example:
http s://idm-ser v er/de f ault/ es-es/ g er er -le-s y s t em/r ecur sos
If the specified  language is not installed, then Bravura Security Fabric  displays an error.
Alt ernativ ely ,  if the URL used to access Bravura Security Fabric  includes LANG=<lang>-<locale>  in
its query string, then Bravura Security Fabric  loads the skin for the specified  language.
For example, for Spanish enter the URL:
http s://idm-ser v er/de f ault/?LANG=es-es
If the specified  language is not installed, then Bravura Security Fabric  falls back to American English (en-
us).
If the URL includes both a locale in the path, and a LANG query parameter, then the locale specified  in
the path takes precedence; for example, Spanish will be loaded from the following URL:
http s://idm-ser v er/de f ault/ es-es/?LANG=tr -tr
Using browser preferences
If no language is specified  in the URL, Bravura Security Fabric  checks the browser for the user’s language
preferences. If no exact match is found among the installed languages, Bravura Security Fabric  uses the
closest related language. For example, if the browser preferences are set to:
▪Polish (pl-pl)▪
▪French/Canada (fr-ca)▪
and Bravura Security Fabric  has Portuguese/Portugal (pt-pt) and French/France (fr-fr) language skins
installed, Bravura Security Fabric  will fir s t check for Polish language packs, then French, settling  onFrench/France (fr-fr). If a related language cannot be found, Bravura Security Fabric  defaults to American
English (en-us).
Using the language selector
If multiple  languages have been installed, a language selector is available in the top right hand corner of
the login page. Click the language selector icon to display the available languages, then select the
language you want to use.
To access the language selector after  you have logged in, click the user menu icon fir s t,  then scroll down
to the language selector. The available languages will be displayed. You can then select the language you
want to use.
Determining date / time  display preference
By default, Bravura Security Fabric  displays date and time  to users as follows:
▪On request-detail pages and in emails, the date and time  are displayed based on the (Windows) ▪
regional settings  for the psadmin user on the Bravura Security Fabric  server.
▪In HTML da t e/time  widgets, the date and time  are displayed by default in the format: ▪
YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
To add time  zone in f ormation,  so that date and time  are displayed as:YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm (UTC+/-HH:mm)
enable the DISPLAY TIMEZONE  option  (Manage the system  > Modules  > Options ).
Bravura Security Fabric  can also display the date and time  based on individual users’ preferences. Users
set their preferences using the following pr ofile  and request attribut es,  which a product administrator
must add in the Manage the system (PSA) module:
PREFERRED_DATEFORMAT  A string r epr esenting  the date format. The character c ombinations  that you
can use in the string and their meaning are as follows:
Character Combination Meaning
d Day of month as digits with no leading zero.
dd Day of month as digits. Use a leading zero for single digit days.
ddd Day of week as a thr ee-letter  abbr e viation.
dddd Day of week as its full name.
M Month as digits with no leading zero.
MM Month as digits. Use a leading zero for single digit months.
MMM Month as a thr ee-letter  abbr e viation.
MMMM Month as its full name.
y Year as last two digits with no leading zero.
yy Year as last two digits. Use a leading zero for single digit years.
yyy Year represented by full four or fiv e digits, depending on the calendar used.
yyyy Same as yyyy.
gg Period or era string.
Character c ombinations  are c ase-sensitiv e.  Literal characters, except for white space, must be
surrounded by single quotes. For example, If you want Bravura Security Fabric  to display the date as:
Thu, Dec 31 09
use the following date format:
"ddd’,’ MMM dd yy"
PREFERRED_TIMEFORMAT  A string r epr esenting  the date format. The character c ombinations  that you
can use in the string and their meaning are as follows:
Character Combination Meaning
h Hours on a 12-hour clock, with no leading zero.
hh Hours on a 12-hour clock. Use a leading zero for single-digit hours.
H Hours on a 24-hour clock, with no leading zero for single-digit hours.
HH Hours on a 24-hour clock. Use a leading zero for single-digit hours.
m Minutes with no leading zero.
mm Minutes with leading zero for single-digit minutes.Character Combination Meaning
s Seconds with no leading zero.
ss Seconds with leading zero for single-digit seconds.
t One character time  marker string, such as A or P .
tt Multi-char act er  time  marker string, such as AM or PM.
Character c ombinations  are c ase-sensitiv e.  Literal characters, except for white space, must be
surrounded by single quotes. For example, If you want Bravura Security Fabric to display the time  as:
23:14
use the following date format:
HH’:’mm
PREFERRED_TIMEZONE  The name of the user’s preferred time  zone.
The name must match one of the time  zone keys stored in the Windows registry on the Bravura Security
Fabric  server; for example, Central Standard Time . These keys are listed under:
HKEY_L OCAL_MA CHINE\SOFTW ARE\Micr osoft\Window s  NT\CurrentVersion\Time Zones
The PREFERRED_DATEFORMAT, PREFERRED_TIMEFORMAT , and pr e f err ed_time z one  pr ofile  and
request attribut es  do not exist by default. You must create them before they can be set. It is
recommended that you create these pr ofile  and request attribut es,  especially the preferred time  zone,
using restricted values  to make c on figur ation  of their values easier for end users.

See Pr ofile  and Request Attribut es  (on page 1264) to learn how to create pr ofile  and request attribut es.
See Altering Text  (on page 3485) to learn how to modify or add text in multiple  languages.Altering text
The text that Bravura Security Fabric  displays to users is partially  de fined  in KVGroup files located in
\<instance>\design\src\common\. Each installed skin or language requires its own set of KVGroup files.
Most UI text is contained in <lang>-<locale>-language.kvg . You can edit and add language
tags to this file. Tags in <lang>-<locale>-errmsg.kvg  are used mainly to compose email
messages, error/warning/info messages emitted  from the Bravura Security Fabric  server. You can edit
text in this file, but you cannot add tags.
For American English, these files are named en-us-language.kvg  and en-us-errmsg.kvg .
Tags in <lang>-<locale>-errmsg.kvg  cannot be used in JavaScript or TypeScript files.  As a result
you cannot include these tags in the Angular portion  of the skin, or the portions  of the Legacy skin that
use JavaScript. Tags in <lang>-<locale>-language.kvg  can be used everywhere.
You can modify the text using the Bravura Security Fabric  translator interface ( transcgi ) or by editing
the KVGroup files themselves.
Alter text with the Bravura Security Fabric  translator interface
The Bravura Security Fabric  translator interface (transcgi) allows you to make text changes on the GUI.
The translator interface is disabled by default. To enable it:
1.Click Manage the system  > Modules  > Options . 1.
2.In the text field  for the TRANSCGI ALLOWED IP option,  enter a comma-delimited list of IP addresses 2.
with CIDR not ation
The purpose of the IP addresses field  is to identif y  specific  external server(s) that are allowed to
access the Bravura Security Fabric  server within the boundaries of the specified  access rights. This is
accomplished by using Classless Inter-Domain R outing  (CIDR) not ation  to de fine  an IP address block.
The address block is represented by an IP address and a pr e fix  size and is written  in slash not ation
<IP>/<pr e fix>  where:
▪IP is the IPv4 (<0-255>.<0-255>.<0-255>.<0-255>) or IPv6 address (<0000- ff ff>:<0000- ff ff>:<0000- ▪
ff ff>:<0000- ff ff>:<0000- ff ff>:<0000- ff ff>:<0000- ff ff>:<0000- ff ff>)
▪ pr e fix  is the pr e fix  size for the mask and must be an integer within the range 0-32 for IPv4 or 0-128 ▪
for IPv6
The subnet mask determines the size of the address block (the number of IP addresses belonging to
the block), and used in c onjunction  with the IP address, specifies  which particular  IP addresses belong
to that block. Some planning is required. You need to determine whether the entry is going to be used
to represent a single address or a range of c onsecutiv e  addresses.
The size of the address block, or the number of IP addresses that the block contains is
number of entries = 2(32- < subnetmask > )
To determine the IP addresses of the servers that will be granted access to the Bravura Security Fabric
server from the IP address/subnet entry do the following:1.Turn the IP address into binary not ation;  for example, 1.
▪128.10.12.1 = 10000000.00001010.00001100.00000001▪
2.Start at the left hand side of the binary r epr esen t ation  and mark off the number of binary digits 2.
specified  by the subnet mask; for example, using a 30 bit subnet mask, the fir s t 30 digits are
marked off (bolded).
▪10000000.00001010.00001100.000000 01 ▪
Valid or matching IP addresses must be based on these fir s t 30 digits.
3.Calculate the valid addresses by cr eating  all possible permut ations  using the remaining binary 3.
digits. In this case, there are only two unmasked digits, and as a result there are only 2(32 - 30)=
22= 4 possible addresses that match.
▪10000000.00001010.00001100.000000 00 = 128.10.12.0 ▪
▪10000000.00001010.00001100.000000 01 = 128.10.12.1 ▪
▪10000000.00001010.00001100.000000 10 = 128.10.12.2 ▪
▪10000000.00001010.00001100.000000 11 = 128.10.12.3 ▪
To restrict access to a single server use a complete pr e fix  (32 for IPv4 or 128 for IPv6). This means that
the IP address must match exactly.
To restrict access only to processes (servers) that reside on the Bravura Security Fabric  server, use the
local host address with a complete pr e fix  (127.0.0.1/32 or ::1/128 for IPv4 and IPv6 r espectiv ely).
External access will be denied.
that are allowed to use the translator interface.
3.Click Update . 3.
Updates are written  to the <lang>-<locale>-language.kvg  and <lang>-<locale>-
errmsg.kvg  files in the \<instance>\design\custom\ directory when the skins are regenerated.
Bravura Security Fabric  is shipped with a default skin named en-us for American English.
Once the translator interface is enabled:
1.Open your web browser at the following address:1.
https://<host>/<instance>/cgi/transcgi.exe?LANG=<language-locale>
Bravura Security Fabric  displays the Language translator page listing  all text values. The page can take
some time  to load.Grid-mode interface for fr-frGrid-mode interface for fr-fr
2.Browse the list to locate the text you want to change, and type the new text in the blank field  below it. 2.
Text that has not yet been translated is displayed in *pending*  status.
To exclude the text that has already been translated, scroll to the bottom  of the form and click the
select icon to Show only lines to be translated.
3.Click Update . 3.
Updates take e ff ect  the next time  the skin is generated.
4.Generate and Install the skins4.
To generate and install new or modified  skin files,  use the following format for the commands to run
from the <instance>\design\ directory, where en-us  is American English:
1.Compile the skins:1.
make.bat default en-us
Changes are saved in the instance's <instance>\design\skin\ directory
2.Install the skins:2.
make.bat install default en-us
The compiled files are copied to the instance's skin\ directory
3.If necessary, reload and review any changes to Bravura Security Fabric  web pages. 3.
Do not run the second command to install the skins if they fail to compile, especially if the firs t m4
file (links.m4) fails to compile.
Skins can fail to compile if something in the environment is locking the skin files.  That can be a
malware program, an automated backup tool running at the time,  but more likely the product UI itself
being in use at the time  of the skin c ompilation
Have a test instance where you can compile the skins when the instance is not being used. Make a
backup copy of the files on the production  instance in case you need to quickly roll them back. Review
changes on the test instance, then copy the skin files to the production  instance.
.
Alter text by editing  KVG files
You can alter the text displayed on Bravura Security Fabric  web pages by modifying the appropriate tags
in en-us-errmsg.kvg and en-us-language.kvg. To do this:
1.Find the tag that corresponds to the text you want to modify1.
2.Search for the tag name in en-us-errmsg.kvg  and en-us-language.kvg . 2.
3.Create a custom file in custom\. 3.
Tags in <lang>-<locale>-errmsg.kvg  cannot be used in JavaScript or TypeScript files.  As a
result you cannot include these tags in the Angular portion  of the skin, or the portions  of the Legacy
skin that use JavaScript. Tags in <lang>-<locale>-language.kvg  can be used everywhere.
This file must have the same name as the original. It must also include the outer KVGroup:# KVGROUP-V1.0 
"language" "EN_US" = { 
}
4.Copy the KVGroup whose key matches the tag name you determined in Step 1 from the source file to 4.
the custom file. For example:
# KVGROUP-V1.0 
"language" "EN_US" = { 
  "_CGILOGIN_ENTER_LOGIN_ID" "" = { 
    "text" = "Please enter your network login ID:" 
  } 
}
5.Modify the text value to suit your needs. For example:5.
# KVGROUP-V1.0 
"language" "EN_US" = { 
  "_CGILOGIN_ENTER_LOGIN_ID" "" = { 
    "text" = "Please enter your employee ID:" 
  } 
}
6.Save and close the custom KVGroup file. 6.
7.Generate and install the new skin files. (on page 3477) 7.
To modify the text for other languages that you have installed, follow the above procedure but replace
en-us in the filename  and EN_US  in the outer KVGroup with the appropriate language code.
If your new text must include quotes, it is highly recommended that you use single quotes (') rather than
double quotes ("). If you must use double quotes, they must be escaped properly.
For text that appears within an HTML widget, a double quote must be preceded by three backslashes (\\
\"). For "normal" text, a double quote must be preceded by a single backslash (\").
Add language tags
Anywhere you de fine  text that users can see, you can use language tags in order to have that text
translated for the end user. For example, you can specify a tag name as a target description,  or when you
create a pr e-de fined  question  in the Manage the system (PSA) module. Any time  custom text is f ormatted
as a language tag, Bravura Security Fabric  will attemp t  to replace that tag with its counterpart in the
associated KVG file.
Tags in <lang>-<locale>-errmsg.kvg  cannot be used in JavaScript or TypeScript files.  As a result
you cannot include these tags in the Angular portion  of the skin, or the portions  of the Legacy skin that
use JavaScript. Tags in <lang>-<locale>-language.kvg  can be used everywhere.
To add your own language tags:
1.Create a custom <lang>-<locale>-language.kvg  file in the custom\ directory. This file must 1.
include the outer KVGroup:
# KVGROUP-V1.0
