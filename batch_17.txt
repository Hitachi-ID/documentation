This chapter provides an overview of softw ar e  components, on various servers throughout the network,
of a Bravura Security Fabric  ins t allation.  This includes:
▪Core server softw ar e  (on page 169) ▪
▪ Optional  local agents and services  (on page 171) ▪
This chapter also shows you how to calculate the number of servers required  (on page 170).
Core server softw ar e
Server softw ar e Description
Database server Stores and manages Bravura Security Fabric data.
The loc ation  of the softw ar e  depends on the third-party database
management system (DBMS) that you are using. This is explained further
in Where to install the softw ar e . You will also need to install database
client softw ar e  on the Bravura Security Fabric  server. For Micr osoft  SQL
Server, it is recommended that you install the database on Windows
Server 2014, 2016 or 2019.
For ins t allation  details see Installing Database and Database Client
Softw ar e  (on page 172).
Bravura Security Fabric  server Provides web access (the GUI), core functionality ,  and essential  services.
The softw ar e  is installed on a Windows-based server. It is recommended
that you install on three or more replicated servers. See Calculating  the
number of servers required  (on page 170)
For ins t allation  details see Installing the Bravura Security Fabric  Server
Softw ar e  (on page 196).
Connector Pack Facilitates c ommunic ation  between the Bravura Security Fabric  server and
the target systems.
The connectors are installed on the Bravura Security Fabric  server, as well
as all replicated servers. They must also be installed on any proxy servers
that are utiliz ed  by the Bravura Security Fabric server. For ins t allation
details see the Connector Pack Documen t ation .
Optional
Bravura Security Fabric proxy server Fulfills  requests on behalf of the Bravura Security Fabric server. The proxy
service is useful for securing c onnections  or accessing client softw ar e.
This optional  softw ar e  is installed on a Windows-based server. For
ins t allation  details see Installing a Proxy Server  (on page 260).Server softw ar e Description
Mobile Proxy Service (mobproxy) This server runs on the Mobile Access proxy server and communicates
with the Mobile Worker Service ( mobworker ) to allow the Bravura One
app on mobile devices to access Bravura Security Fabric  servers.
This optional  softw ar e  is installed on a Linux-based server. For ins t allation
details see Mobile access  (on page 1444)
Calculating  the number of servers required
Bravura Security  strongly recommends that you create at least two or three replicated Bravura Security
Fabric  database nodes for fault tolerance and backup, depending on which products are licensed and
which features are implemented. When Bravura Privilege  is installed, or when close to 100% uptime  is
required from the instance, the recommended minimum is three. This is because when backend
database r eplic ation  is performed, at least two database nodes have to go down at the same time.
On the other hand, avoid setting  up too many replicated database nodes. It is likely that the additional
overhead of any more than six fully replicated nodes would outweigh the advantage of having multiple
nodes to do work. If you implement transparent password s ynchr oniz ation,  it is recommended that you
avoid having more than fiv e concurrently activ e  database nodes.
Calculate the number of database nodes you require with the following formula:
N = ceil(1 + [ U∕P * 7∕5∕Z * A]∕[60  * 60 * C∕T])
Where:
▪U = # of users▪
▪P = days between password expiry▪
▪Z = time  zones ▪
▪A = accounts/user▪
▪C = # of concurrently running connectors▪
▪T = seconds on average to change a password▪
For example, when:
▪U = 10000 people▪
▪P = 45 days▪
▪Z = 1 time  zone ▪
▪A = 10 accounts/user▪
▪C = 30 connectors at a time ▪
▪T = 2 seconds▪
then:
▪N = ceil(1 + [10000∕45 * 7∕5∕1 * 10]∕[60 * 60 * 30∕2]) ▪
