# By default, if pre-existing configuration file(s) contains all the 
# required options, do not replace them. 
  use-preexisting-cfg = "Y";  
2.Edit < psunix-root>/conf/psunix.cfg  to de fine  the c ommunic ation  key (or Master Key) that 2.
matches the one set during ins t allation  on the Bravura Security Fabric  server; for example:  
     commkey = "<encrypted commkey value>";  
Optionally ,  you can pr e-c on figur e  other options  in this file if you want diff er en t  behavior from the
default. See the Connector Pack Documen t ation  for details.
3.Edit the pspasswd and pushpass c on figur ation  files.  (on page 1719) 3.
4.Run the shell script install.sh from the root of the ins t allation  package: 4.
  sh install.sh  -c 2 -ni  [ -inst <instancename> ]  
where:
Option Description
-inst Specifies  the instance name for loc ation  of the psunix
files.  If omitted,  files are copied to the /usr/local/
psunix/default instance  (on page 1711).
pspasswd and non-default instances
The psunix local instance name, de fined  by the -inst option  when running the install.sh  script, is
not connected to the main Bravura Security Fabric  instance name. If specified,  it designates a sub-target.
During install/setup, if the instance name is the default, the installer symbolically creates a link from:
▪/usr/local/psunix/<instance>/psunix.d to /etc/psunix.d, and▪
▪/usr/local/psunix/<instance>/psunix.cfg to /etc/psunix.cfg▪
The pspasswd binary (due to the fact that only one version can be installed in /usr/bin or /bin) always
looks for /etc/psunix.cfg.
If you want to install pspasswd to run in a non-default instance, you must manually create the
symbolic links to /etc/psunix.d and /etc/psunix.cfg.
Con figur e  the Bravura Pass  PAM
To e ff ectiv ely  intercept all password changes made using PAM-enabled applic ations,  you can install the
Bravura Pass  PAM ( pspam.so ) on every Unix server where users might change their local or NIS/NIS+
passwords. The Bravura Pass  PAM, pspam.so, is currently available for Solaris, HP-UX, and Linux systems.
See notes about s ynchr oniz ation  in an NIS / NIS+ environment  (on page 1718).
The Bravura Pass  PAM applies password strength rules de fined  on the Bravura Pass  server to all new
password selections.  It intercepts the password change event on the Unix server, and forwards a request
for s ynchr oniz ation  to the Bravura Pass  server.Alternately, you can replace the nativ e  password program  (on page 1708) with pspasswd to intercept
password changes made using the standard password command ( passwd ).
The password replacement program ( pspasswd ) is inc ompatible  with pspam.so . Installing both can
cause undesirable side e ff ects,  unless the pspam.so  is c onfigured  to be used on login only.
Install the Bravura Pass  PAM
Before you begin, note the c ommunic ation  key (or Master Key). The CommKey value is encrypted in
Bravura Security Fabric . If you did not record the key in a secure loc ation,  copy the idmsetup.inf file
from <instance> \ p sc on fig \ on the Bravura Security Fabric server to the same loc ation  as the installer.
The installer will extract the Communic ation  Key value from the file.
To install pspam.so  on a Unix server:
1.If you did not select the Unix Ins t allation  Packages when you installed the Connector Pack, install the 1.
psunix ins t allation  package  (on page 1707).
2.Run the shell script install.sh , in in t er activ e  mode, from the root of the ins t allation  package: 2.
 sh install.sh 3 [ -inf <path>/idmsetup.inf ]  
3.Follow the ins tructions  displayed by the installer script. 3.
In the c on figur ation  process:
a.Allow a ff ect ed  files to be backed up. a.
b.Select the "Pam Transparent Synch" ins t allation  option. b.
c.If you want to use the c on figur ation  options  that exist in /etc/psunix.cfg, type Y when asked. If you c.
want to change the values (for example, the idpm server name and port number), type n.
d.Enter the target ID of the target used to target this system.d.
e.Enter the URL of the API SOAP Service.e.
f.Enter a proxy URL if you are using a proxy. Press [Enter] if you are not using a proxy. f.
g.Enter the proxy user name if you are using a proxy. Press [Enter] if you are not using a proxy. g.
h.Enter the proxy user name’s password if you are using a proxy. Press [Enter] if you are not using a h.
proxy.
i.If you are using SSL, enter the path holding the CA certific a t e(s).  Press [Enter] if you are not using i.
SSL.j.If you are using SSL, enter the certific a t e  details. Press [Enter] if you are not using SSL. j.
k. De fine  the [libcurl] path or press [Enter] to use the system default libcurl library. k.
l. De fine  the [ignore] or press [Enter] to use the default value. l.
m. De fine  the user name for login to the IDAPI service. m.
n. De fine  the password for the IDAPI user. n.
Note: This install option  does not put the module into the PAM stack. You must copy the file to the
proper loc ation  and correctly declare it in the corresponding PAM c on figur ation  files.
4.Check the /etc/pam.conf file on your Unix server to determine if your system uses PME (password 4.
management extensions).
A machine without PME normally uses only one PAM module, pam_unix.so. A machine with PME
splits the functions  of pam_unix.so into several diff er en t  modules:
▪pam_dhkeys.so,▪
▪pam_authtok_get.so,▪
▪pam_authtok_check.so, and▪
▪pam_authtok_store.so.▪
5.Copy the appropriate PAM file from the psunix directory to the /usr/lib/security/ directory and 5.
rename it to pspam.so:
▪If your Solaris system uses PME, copy:▪
psunix/pspam/pspam_pme.so.<OS>.<ARCH>
▪If your Solaris, HP-UX, or Linux system does not use PME, copy:▪
psunix/pspam/pspam.so.<OS>.<ARCH>
Next:
Edit the /etc/pam.conf file.
Edit pam.conf
The following sections  describe how to c on figur e  HP-UX and Solaris (with and without PME (password
management extensions)) systems, to use the Bravura Pass  PAM.
Be very careful when editing  /etc/pam.conf, as a misc onfiguration  can result in your system becoming
inaccessible. Always keep a login shell open while editing  this and test the login mechanism before
closing the shell.
These modules are not shipped with Connector Pack 4.6 or newer. Support can be provided at additional
cost.
Con figur ation  for HP-UX
The password management section  of /etc/pam.conf on HP-UX systems is normally written  as follows:
login    password required  /usr/lib/security/libpam_unix.1
passwd   password required  /usr/lib/security/libpam_unix.1dtlogin  password required  /usr/lib/security/libpam_unix.1
dtaction password required  /usr/lib/security/libpam_unix.1
OTHER    password required  /usr/lib/security/libpam_unix.1
For each applic ation  (login, passwd, dtlogin, dt action,  other) that should use pspam.so,  edit /etc/
pam.conf as follows:
1.Append use_first_pass  to the end of each line. 1.
2.Type a new line above each e xisting  line in the format:  2.
<app> password required /usr/lib/security/pspam.so <option>  
If the applic ation  is a login applic ation,  include the get_old_pass option  as follows. 
login password required /usr/lib/security/pspam.so get_old_pass  
See Module options
The pspam.so  module supports the following command line options:
Option Description
use_fir s t_pass Do not prompt for passwords. Instead, The module relies
upon passwords obtained by prior modules in the
module stack. Do not use this option  if pspam.so  is the
fir s t module in an applic ation’ s  stack.
debug Write all debug-level logging to syslog.
The pspam.so  module logs to syslog using the
LOG_AUTH or LOG_AUTHPRIV facility (see the Unix man
page for more in f ormation  about syslog).
get_old_pass Always prompt the user for his or her old password. This
option  is only necessary for login applic ations.
When login requests a password change it runs as
root. Normally, if this option  is not specified,  the PAM
module allows root to change a user’s password without
pr ompting  for the user’s old password.
Non-root users are always prompted to enter their
current passwords.
-conf <c on ffile> Use the specified  c on figur ation  file. If this option  is not
specified,  /etc/psunix.cfg is used.

Con figur ation  for Solaris 8/9 without PME
The password management section  of /etc/pam.conf on Solaris systems without PME is normally written
as follows:
other   password required  /usr/lib/security/pam_unix.so.1
To customize /etc/pam.conf to work with the Bravura Pass  PAM for Solaris without PME:
1.Append  use_first_pass  to the end of the "other" line as follows: 1.
other   password required /usr/lib/security/
pam_unix.so.1 use_first_pass
2.Add a new "other" line for the pspam.so  module above the fir s t one as follows: 2.
other   password required /usr/lib/security/pspam.so get_old_pass
3.See Module options 3.
The pspam.so  module supports the following command line options:
Option Description

Con figur ation  for Solaris 8/9 with PME
The password management section  of /etc/pam.conf on Solaris systems with PME is normally written  as
follows:
other   password required    pam_dhkeys.so.1
other   password requisite   pam_authtok_get.so.1
other   password requisite   pam_authtok_check.so.1
other   password required    pam_authtok_store.so.1
For each applic ation  that should use pspam_pme.so :
1.Replace the line:  1.
<app> password requisite  pam_authtok_get.so.1  
with: 
<app> password requisite  pspam.so <options>

other   password required    pam_authtok_store.so.1
Con figur ation  for Linux
For systems using /etc/pam.d/*
To replace the use of pam_unix.so for strength checking, and enable transparent s ynchr oniz ation  with all
applic ations  that use PAM, edit the /etc/pam.d/ c on figur ation  file. For RHEL-based system this is
usually /etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac. For Debian-based systems, this is usually /etc/pam.d/common-
password. The c on figur ation  file normally contains a line similar to the following:
  password required pam_unix.so nullok obscure min=4 max=8 md5
Add the following below the e xisting  pam_unix.so line:
  password required pspam.so
If you only want to a ff ect  a particular  applic ation,  add the pspam.so line to the appropriate /etc/pam.d/
<app> file.If using a RHEL based system with SELinux, you must ensure that pspam.so is labeled with the correct
SELinux security context. To relabel the file and then change its default label, run the following
commands as root:
 chcon textrel_shlib_t /lib/security/pspam.so
 semanage fcontext -a -t textrel_shlib_t -f -- \
        /lib/security/pspam.so
For systems using /etc/pam.conf
For Linux systems using /etc/pam.conf follow the c on figur ation  ins tructions  for Solaris 2.6/7 and Solaris
8/9 without PME.  (on page 1715)
Unix with NIS or NIS+
Normally, in an NIS or NIS+ environment:
1.There is a single, master password for every user.1.
2.Password changes made on an NIS client are aut omatic ally  propagated to the NIS master server. When 2.
this happens, only the password hash, and not the plaintext password, is sent to the NIS master
server.
3.Password resets are only possible on the master server.3.
4.In NIS, password resets must be made by manually editing  the passwd map file. 4.
Bravura Pass  allows you to extend the reach of the single NIS password:
1.Password changes made in the NIS environment can be aut omatic ally  propagated to other, non-NIS 1.
systems.
2.Password changes made outside of NIS can be aut omatic ally  propagated to the NIS environment. 2.
3.Password resets can be made from the command-line of the NIS master, or from a web browser,3.
replacing the manual editing  process.
4. Pr opag ation  of new passwords between an NIS master and its secondaries can be replaced by Bravura 4.
Pass  password pr opag ation,  which is much faster.
The ins t allation  process is the same as for individual Unix servers, with the following e x ceptions:
1.The Bravura Pass  Unix server / listener is only installed on the NIS master server. 1.
2.You need to edit additional  scripts for an NIS connector. See the Connector Pack Documen t ation . 2.
3.A replacement passwd program ( pspasswd ) must be installed on all NIS client machines, and not 3.
just on the master. This is required because Bravura Pass  needs access to plaintext password values to
synchronize with other systems, but the NIS master only receives password hashes, and not plaintext
passwords.
Alternately, you can replace passwd on the NIS clients with a shell script that can:
▪Invoke a web browser, pr ompting  users to change their passwords using a Bravura Pass  web interface. ▪
▪Use a program such as SSH to run the passwd program on the NIS master server.▪E diting  psunix c on figur ation  files
Bravura Security Fabric  add-ons that you install on a Unix-based server use a c on figur ation  file to de fine
in t er action  between the add-on, the Unix server, and the Bravura Security Fabric  server. By default, this
file is /etc/psunix.cfg ; however, most add-ons allow you to specify an alternate file.
When you install  Bravura Security Fabric  add-on on Unix using an installer script (for example, install.sh),
the installer creates a psunix.cfg  file and c on figur es  the required values. You can later edit this file to
c on figur e  additional  options  or change your settings.
The psunix.d c on figur ation  directory contains several c on figur ation  files that contain the settings  for the
various psunix add-ons, including the pushpass file, which contains settings  for transparent
password s ynchr oniz ation.
See also
Connector Pack Documen t ation  for more in f ormation  about psunix  scripts.
passwd utility  c on figur ation
The pspasswd file specifies  the passwd utility  used to perform an oper ation  on a non- Bravura Security
Fabric  users password. Usually, this option  specifies  oper ating  system’s passwd command. The nativ e
password oper ation  is executed if the user is contained in the [restricted-user-list] option,  or is contained
in the ignore list on the Bravura Security Fabric  server. The options  are as follows:
passwd-cmd-reset  A reset oper ation  is less strict than a change oper ation  since it does not validate
the users old password fir s t.  Most nativ e  passwd commands do both change and reset oper ations
depending on who is running the command and the arguments passed on the command line. Generally,
running the passwd command as superuser is considered a password reset oper ation.
This option  accepts psunix textual replacement strings, notably the "%u" keyword indic ating  the
username.
Example:
        passwd-cmd-reset = "/bin/passwd.bin %u";
passwd-cmd-change A change oper ation  is more strict than a reset oper ation  since it validates the users
old password fir s t.  Most nativ e  passwd commands do both change and reset oper ations  depending on
who is running the command and the arguments passed on the command line. Generally, running the
passwd command as a non-privledged user is considered a password change oper ation.
This option  accepts psunix textual replacement strings, notably the "%u" keyword indic ating  the
username.
Example:
        passwd-cmd-change = "/usr/bin/yppasswd %u";Exit status codes
The following table outlines the pspasswd exit status codes:
Error code Description
0 Success.
1 Syntax error in PSLang override script.
2 Failed to acquire password policy from remote idpm/
pushpass service (using legacy protocol).
3 Failed to reset password using nativ e  command line tool.
4 Failed to reset password.
API SOAP Service c on figur ation
The idapi file is used to c on figur e  the c onnection  to API SOAP Service ( idapisoap ). The options  are
as follows:
▪ t ar g etid  If you are using aliasing, this option  is used to specify the ID of the target. ▪
Example:
        targetid = "UNIXSERVER";
▪url The url that API SOAP Service is listening on. ▪
Example:
        url = "http://hipmserver/default/idapi";
▪user The product administrator used to connect to the API SOAP Service. ▪
Example:
        user = "_API_USER";
▪psw The product administrator password used to connect to the API SOAP Service. idaptool can ▪
be used to provide an encyrpted form of the password.
Example:
        psw = "{AES}xdWShI2f
+fM7Bd0SRhIi9kHvdhM9Y0fVxvKjpIbHfp4T47X2IAjLakoNitoSfu4Z" ;
▪libcurl In order to communicate to the API SOAP Service over SSL, the libcurl is required. If the full ▪
path is specified,  then the library can be loaded when c onnecting  over SSL. If no libcurl is avalable and
plain HTTP is used, the value can be set to ’0’. If empty, the system default is used.
Example:
        libcurl = "0";
▪capath When c ommunic ating  to the API SOAP Service over SSL, a certific a t e  check will be made unless ▪
ignore is set to "1". If the CA certific a t e  is not installed on the system default paths, a path can be
specified.
Example:
