}5 Aut omatic  Assignment
In addition  to role enforcement  (on page 2409), Bravura Security Fabric  supports role-based access
control with aut omatic  assignment. Aut omatic  assignment is controlled by user class. Users who are
members of a c on figur ed  user class can be assigned a resource (role or managed group) aut omatic ally  if
they do not already have it. The resource can be removed from non-members. This aut omation  is
triggered during a scheduled job, and in real time  when a user’s user class membership changes.
Aut omatic  assignment works with the following:
Components Purpose
View and update pr ofile  (IDR) module Allows users to request changes to pr ofile  attribut es  or
group membership.
W orkflo w  Manager Service Handles requests to add or remove resources. The
requests can be auto-approved or reviewed by
authorizers.
autores Determines de ficits  and surpluses and issues requests
to assign role and group membership.
You cannot enable role enforcement and aut omatic  assignment at the same time  for managed groups.
Typical aut omatic  assignments may proceed in the following way:  
User requests a change in department 
1.The user submits a request to update pr ofile  in f ormation  that is linked to an account attribut e  on a 1.
target system.
2.When the request for the attribut e  update is approved, Bravura Security Fabric aut omatic ally  submits 2.
additional  requests:
▪Remove the user from the original department group (auto-approved change).▪
▪Add the user to the new department group (requires approval).▪
User added to the Support group on an Activ e  Directory domain 
1.The group membership change is detected during auto discovery . 1.
2.Bravura Security Fabric aut omatic ally  submits a request: 2.
▪Add the user to the help desk role (requires approval).▪
How aut omatic  assignment works
Bravura Security Fabric  uses user classes and the autores  program to communicate with the W orkflo w
Manager Service to aut omatic ally  assign roles and groups:
▪ Aut omatic  assignment options  are set in the resource’s Assignment tab. ▪
▪During auto discovery , the autores program compares a list of users who are members of a user ▪
class with a list of users who are assigned the resource.▪The program submits a request to add the resource if a user class member is found to be in de ficit. ▪
The program can be c on figur ed  to submit a request to remove the resource from a user if they are
found to be in surplus.
▪When a user submits a request that a ff ects  user class membership (an attribut e  or group membership ▪
is changed), pot ential  aut omatic  assignments are detected and submitted  once the initial  request has
been approved and processed.
Only direct group memberships are counted when c alculating  deficits  and surpluses. The autores
program will not submit requests to remove indirect group memberships.
Setting  up aut omatic  assignment
To set up aut omatic  assignment:
1.Determine what resources (managed groups or roles) you want to aut omatic ally  provision. 1.
Do this by c on figuring  group auto assignment  (on page 606) or  role auto assignment  (on page 641)
options.
2.Determine who should have the resources.2.
Con figur e  user classes  (on page 733) to determine if a user is allowed to be assigned the resource.
3.Set the AUTO ASSIGNMENT PROPAGATE REQUESTER variable in W orkflo w  > Options  > Aut omation 3.
to de fine  the pr ofile  ID to use for automated requests. Con figur e  other aut omation  options  if
required.
4.Set up authoriz ation  for aut omatic  assignment by assigning authorizers at the resource level, or 4.
determine authoriz ation  dynamically with a plugin program or user class.
Automated w orkflo w  request options
Bravura Security Fabric  can aut omatic ally  assign roles and groups to users on the basis of user class. The
autores program, run in a scheduled job as part of PSUPDATE, compares members of a class with a
list of users who have a resource. The program can be c on figur ed  to submit requests to assign or remove
resources. When a user initia t es  a request, pot ential  aut omatic  assignments will be detected and
submitted  once the initial  request has been approved and processed.
See usage in f ormation  for autores
Use the autores program to determine the aut omatic  role and group de ficits  and surpluses and issue
requests. When aut omatic  assignment is c on figur ed,  the program is run aut omatic ally  at the end of the
auto discovery process.

Aut omatic  assignment request splitting
You can use a plugin to break up aut omatic  assignment requests into separate requests; for example to
make alloc ations  take place immediately, and de-alloc ations  take place later.
To use an aut omatic  assignment request splitting  plugin:
1.Click Manage the system > W orkflo w  > Options  > Aut omation . 1.2.Type the name of the plugin program or PSLang script in the AUTO ASSIGNMENT REQUEST SPLIT 2.
field.
3.Click Update . 3.
There are no shipped plugins for the aut omatic  assignment request splitting  plugin point. See more
in f ormation  on writing  a customized plugin
Requirements
The plugin must be placed in the \<instance>\plugin\ directory and runs on the Bravura Security Fabric
server. See W riting  plugins  for general requirements.
Ex ecution  points
The aut omatic  assignment request splitting  plugin is run when end users view requests in the View and
update pr ofile  (idr) module and Requests app, and when the autores program executes.
Input
The aut omatic  assignment request splitting  plugin receives in f ormation  about oper ations  to be
performed on resources, for example:
  "" "" = {
    "request" "" = {
      // All actions generated to resolve variances from this run
      "resource" "" = {
      ...
      }
      "resource" "" = {
      ...
      }
      ...
    }
    // Existing generated auto assignment requests
    "request" "" = {
      "autoressig" = "..."
      "requestID" = "..."
      // Existing resources in this request
      "resource" "" = {
      ...
      }
      "resource" "" = {
      ...
      }
    }    ...
    "request" "" = {
      ...
    }
  }
Output
The aut omatic  assignment request splitting  plugin returns changes to the original request:
  "" "" = {
   // Changes are made for existing requests
    "request" "" = {
      "autoressig" = "..."
      "requestID" = "..."
      // Resources should be in this request
      "resource" "" = {
      ...
      }
      "resource" "" = {
      ...
      }
    }
    ...
    // New requests
    "request" "" = {
      "resource" "" = {
      ...
      }
      "resource" "" = {
      ...
      }
    }
    "changed" = "true"/"false"
    // If the requests that are not returned should be retained or removed
    "retainResources" = "true"/"false"
    "retval" = "0"
    "errmsg" = ""
  }
.Aut omatic  assignment filt ering
You can use a plugin to filt er  aut omatic  resource assignment requests on a per-user basis.
To use an aut omatic  assignment filt er  plugin:
1.Click Manage the system > W orkflo w  > Options  > Aut omation . 1.
2.Type the name of the plugin program or PSLang script in the AUTO ASSIGNMENT VARIANCE FILTER 2.
field.
3.Click Update . 3.
There are no shipped plugins for the aut omatic  assignment filt er  plugin point. See more in f ormation  on
writing  a customized plugin.
Ex ecution  points
The aut omatic  assignment filt er  plugin is run when the user attemp ts  to view aut omatic ally  assigned
resources. The plugin is also run when the autores program executes.
Filter plugins operate diff er en tly  from most plugins, which are synchronous. All filt er  plugins support
asynchronous calling. There are two forms of asynchronous calling:
▪Standard input/output mode that processes standard filt er  plugin input/output. ▪
In standard input/output (stdio) mode, filt er  plugins work in the following way:
1.An event triggers a CGI program to call the plugin program or script and sends it standard user data 1.
(on page 1514).
2.The calling program c ontinues  to stream input from stdin, one item at a time  until  there are no 2.
more items.
3.For each item, the plugin returns the filt er  result to stdout. 3.
4.The calling program receives the final  standard output and c ontinues. 4.
Input
Input is similar for all resource filt er  plugins. The plugin fir s t receives standard data in the format:
"" "" = {
  "sessionid" = "<session ID>" # The session ID of the request.
  "module" = "<idr|ids|idp|idwfm>"
  "accountID" = "<account ID>" # The account ID of the recipient.
  "template = "<template ID>" # The selected template ID.
  "targetid" = "<target ID>" # The target ID for the recipient.
  "navigation" "" = { ... } # User navigation data
                            # See Navigation data  (on page 1521).
  "recipient" "<user|empty>" = {
     # The "recipient" group contains standard information about the
     # subject of the request.     # See Request data  (on page 1506) for details.
   }
  "viewer" "user" = {
     # The "viewer" group contains standard information about the
     # person using the CGI.
     # See User data  (on page 1514) for details.
   }
  "request" "" = {
     # The "request" group contains standard information about the
     # the request.
     # See Request data  (on page 1506) for details.
   }
 }
Some of the values above may be empty, due to the stage and type of the request.
The plugin then receives a series of KVGroups; one for each item. The aut omatic  assignment filt er
plugin receives, for example:
"User" "" = {
  "userid" = "AWaygood"
  "Variance" "" = {
    "type" = "group"
    "id" = "1d05cb04-b2b7-4f09-9af9-e1b6733a98dc"
    "hostid" = "AD"
    "longid" = ""
    "surplus" = "false"
    "throttle" = "true"
  }
  "Variance" "" = {
    "type" = "group"
    "id" = "f1192163-80cc-47e3-9fc7-775af4173002"
    "hostid" = "AD"
    "longid" = ""
    "surplus" = "true"
    "throttle" = "true"
  }
}
Output
For each item, one output KVGroup is expected on stdout, with an optional  "filt er"  = "true" pair to
indicate that the item should not be displayed:
