        "mv_attributes" "" = { 
            #...multi-valued attributes go here... 
        } 
    } 
    "sessionid" = "< session id>" # The session ID 
} 
The expected output of the plugin is an account and unencrypted password:
 "" "" = { 
       "admin" = "<account name>"; 
       "adminPW" = "<unencrypted password>"; 
       "isSysPWD" = "[true | false]"; //optional 
       "isConnPWD" = "[true | false]"; //optional 
       "isUpdByPAM" = "[true | false]"; //optional 
       "retval" = "0" 
   } 
Alt ernativ ely ,  the output of the plugin can be a managed account:
 "" "" = { 
       "admin" = "<managed account ID>"; 
       "adminPW" = ""; 
       "resourceid" = "<managed system ID>"; 
       "accountID" = "<managed account ID>"; 
       "isSysPWD" = "[true | false]"; //optional 
       "isConnPWD" = "[true | false]"; //optional 
       "isUpdByPAM" = "[true | false]"; //optional 
       "retval" = "0" 
   } 
Multiple  cr edentials  can be created using the following format:
 "" "" = { 
      "version" = "2" 
      "resultgroup" "" = { 
         "credential" "" = { 
            "admin" = "<account name>"; 
            "adminPW" = "<unencrypted password>"; 
            "isConnPWD" = "[true | false]"; //optional 
            "isUpdByPAM" = "[true | false]"; //optional 
         } 
         "credential" "" = {             "admin" = "<account name>"; 
            "adminPW" = "<unencrypted password>"; 
            "isConnPWD" = "[true | false]"; //optional 
            "isUpdByPAM" = "[true | false]"; //optional 
            //
To create a system credential add the following kvg group to 
            //a credential 
            "sys" "" = { 
               "admin" = "<sys account name>"; 
               "adminPW" = "<unencrypted password>"; 
               "isConnPWD" = "[true | false]"; //optional 
               "isUpdByPAM" = "[true | false]"; //optional 
            } 
         } 
      } 
      "retval" = "0" 
   } 
Add ”switch_strategies” in the output KVGroup to switch between using cr edentials  from the plugin or
discovery template:
▪"switch_strategies" = "true" will use cr edentials  from the discovery template ▪
▪"switch_strategies" = "false" or not present will use cr edentials  from the plugin ▪

Cr eating  new cr edentials  on a managed system
Con figur e  Bravura Privilege  to create new cr edentials  on a managed discovered system by setting  the
options  de fined  in Table Cr eating  new cr edentials  on a managed system  (on page 2123).
When Bravura Privilege  creates the new cr edentials,  it uses the default global password policy. The
description  for created accounts notes that the account was created by Bravura Privilege , and states
which rule (if any) was used to create it.
If account cr eation  fails on the discovered system, then the system is not managed by Bravura Privilege . If
evaluated against an import rule:
▪For push mode, the system will be re-evaluated on the next run and Bravura Privilege  will attemp t  to ▪
create the administrator account on the system again.
▪For local w ork s t ation  mode, Bravura Privilege  will attemp t  to create the administrator account again ▪
according to the RES ADMIN CREATE RETRY INTERVAL (default 1440 minutes).
If Bravura Privilege  fails to add the new account to any of the selected administrator groups, then the
system is not managed. However, the account remains in the groups that were joined successfully. If this
occurs, either fix or remove the incorrect/missing group ID.Options  for cr eating  new cr edentials  on discovered systems
Option Description
Initial  cr edentials  to use when
cr eating  new local accountThis applies to push mode systems only. Select:
▪Use valid cr edential  from template target system ▪
▪Use cr edentials  from source system ▪
▪Plugin to get cr edentials , and then type the name of a plugin that ▪
de fines  which cr edentials  to use for each discovered system. See Plugin
to get cr edentials  for cr eating  new account  (on page 2124).
Login ID type Set this to de fine  what to use as the administrator ID:
▪String allows you to specify the Login ID to be created on each ▪
discovered system. Use this if you want to use a common ID for the
Bravura Privilege administrator on each discovered system. Or,
▪PSLANG expression  allows you to de fine  the Login ID based on the ▪
discovered system’s attribut es.  Use this if you want a unique
administrator account for each discovered system. For example, using
the expression  "admin"+$comp["name"][0]  could generate the
ID admin_user1-ws .
Security group type De fine  permissions for the new account:
▪String allows you to type a space-delimited list of group IDs for the ▪
groups into which to add the new account; for example,
"Administrator" "Domain users" "Custom group" . Use
this if you know the group IDs for the groups that you want all new
accounts to be added.
▪SID allows you to select from a list of common group SIDs to into which ▪
to add the new account. Use this if your discovered systems use non-
standard administrator group names. This option  is only available for
template types that recognize SID.
This option  is only available when an Activ e  Directory or Windows NT
Server template target system is used.
Reuse e xisting  account if found Enable this option  to reuse the ID if it already exists on the discovered
system.Plugin to get cr edentials  for cr eating  new account
The plugin will receive as input, the computer attribut es.  You can view the available attribut es  by going to
Manage the system > Resources > Discovered objects > Systems , and clicking on the system.
The plugin, in the form of a KVGroup should look like:
"" "" = { 
    "resource" "" = { 
        #...single-valued attribut es  go here... 
    } 
    "sessionid" = "<session id>" # The session ID 
} 
The expected output from the plugin:
 "" "" = { 
       "admin" = "..."; 
       "adminPW" = "<unencrypted password>"; 
       "return" = "0"; 
   } 
Using valid cr edentials  from a template target system
Con figur e  Bravura Privilege  to test and copy administrator cr edentials  from the target system template if
you have groups of systems using the same set of cr edentials.  This way you can select which
administrator cr edentials  to use based on the target system template selected.
This is also useful if the administrator accounts are unique on each system; for example, IDs that use the
format Admin_ <computer name >. In this case, the passwords must be identic al.
If the cr edentials  are invalid, then the system is not imported or managed by Bravura Privilege . Target
systems that require a system password  (on page 518) only have the administrator cr edential  validated,
not the system cr edential.  If the system is imported and managed by Bravura Privilege , then the system
password is copied. If multiple  system passwords are c on figur ed,  then the fir s t alphabetic ally -sort ed
password is copied.
Using cr edentials  from a source system
Copy administrator cr edentials  from the source system if you intend to use a domain administrator
account to manage all discovered systems. This setting  applies to push mode systems only. It is
recommended that the administrator ID on the source system follows the format
<adminid >@<domain >. Bravura Security Fabric  does not verify whether the source system cr edentials
are valid.
If the cr edentials  change on the source system, then Bravura Privilege  aut omatic ally  propagates the new
cr edentials  to the managed systems that are using them. However, if the imported cr edentials  get
removed from the managed system, then Bravura Privilege  stops pr opag ating  source system changes to
that system.E v aluating  import rules
It is highly recommended that you test import rules before running auto discovery  to ensure that they are
c on figur ed  correctly.
Import rules can be manually evaluated against one or more discovered objects (systems or accounts).
You can evaluate:
▪One import rule  (on page 2125) ▪
▪ Multiple  import rules  (on page 2125) ▪
You can then choose to apply the e v aluation  results to manage systems that pass all the c onditions.
You can set all enabled import rules to be re-evaluated and applied on the next auto discovery , by clicking
Force a r e-e v aluation  of all enabled import rules on the next auto discovery on the Import rules  page.
You can also carry out a trial run to evaluate an import rule against all discovered objects.
Managed system and Managed account import rules must be associated with at least one managed
system policy before they can be tested.
Ensure that discovered systems  (on page 2088) have already been c onfigured,  and that accounts have
been listed before e valuating  import rules.
E v aluating  one import rule
You can evaluate one import rule against discovered objects; Target system and Managed system rules
are evaluated against computers, and Managed account  rules are evaluated against accounts.
To evaluate a single import rule against discovered objects:
1.Navigate to the Import rules  page. 1.
2.In the Test c onditions  section,  select which objects to evaluate: 2.
▪Leave the field  blank to evaluate all discovered objects. ▪
You can override the TEST IMPORT RULE MAX LENGTH by entering a value in the Maximum
number of systems to run the test against field.
▪Click the search icon, select the objects to evaluate, and click Select... . ▪
▪Type a space-delimited list of discovered object names.▪
3.Click Test. 3.
4. Optionally ,  you can manage objects that passed all c onditions  (on page 2126). 4.
The e valuation  only runs if there is at least one enabled c ondition  for the rule being evaluated.
E v aluating  multiple  import rules
You can evaluate multiple  import rules and their c onditions  simultaneously. You can evaluate all import
rules to simulate all rules running aut omatic ally  during auto discovery .
To evaluate multiple  import rules:1.Navigate to the Import rules  page. 1.
2.Enable the checkboxes for the rules you want to evaluate.2.
3.Click Test. 3.
4. Optionally ,  you can manage objects that passed all c onditions  (on page 2126). 4.
Applying e v aluation  results
After  an e v aluation  is complete Bravura Security Fabric  displays the results including which objects
(systems and accounts) have passed all the c onditions,  and which objects have failed. If they failed,
Bravura Security Fabric  indicates which c onditions  caused them to fail; however, if an import rule’s
c onditions  is set to “Match any expression”, then the results cannot include an e xplanation  of why an
object failed the e v aluation.
On pr oduction  systems, or with a large set of test matches, run auto discovery  to process discovered
objects and make them into managed systems and managed accounts.
Alt ernativ ely ,  on a test system, you can click Apply  on the Import rules  page to make all objects that
passed all c onditions  into managed systems and managed accounts.
It is not recommended to use the Apply button  with production  systems, or with a large set of Test
matches. It s intended only for t esting.
Once an import rule has processed all discovered objects, either by running auto discovery  or by
e v aluating  the rule and clicking Apply , then those objects are not re-evaluated against the same import
rule again. This includes both passed and failed results.
Discovered systems which pass all c onditions  for a target systems import rule but fail to obtain valid
cr edentials  on subsequent c onnections  are re-evaluated against the import rule, unless they pass and
obtain valid cr edentials  from another rule. This process for local service mode discovered systems will
occur over a few intervals where the client connects to the server.
Use the TEST IMPORT RULE MAX LENGTH system variable ( Manage the system > Resources > Options ,
or from the Import rules tab in Manage the system > Privileged access > Options ) to limit the number of
computers or accounts to evaluate a rule against. The default number of objects is 10. You can increase
this value to evaluate the import rules on more discovered objects.
On the test section  of each import rule you can override the TEST IMPORT RULE MAX LENGTH value by
entering a new value in the Maximum number of systems to run test rule against field.
Ex ecuting  a trial run
You can execute a trial run to test all objects that have not already been evaluated against a rule. The
diff er ence  between a test and a trial run is that:
▪A trial run is run against all objects, regardless of the TEST IMPORT RULE MAX LENGTH value. ▪
▪A report on a trial run is emailed to a designated address.▪
To execute a trial run on an import rule:
1.Navigate to the Import rules  page  (on page 2095). 1.2.Select the Trial run tab. 2.
3.Type an email address to receive results of the test.3.
4.Click Trial run . 4.
To cancel a trial run, click Cancel on the Import rule <rule type > page for the rule. You can only cancel a
trial run from the instance on which it was started.
You can c on figur e  two event actions  (exit traps)  (on page 1524) in Manage the system > Resources >
Options , or from the Import rules tab in Manage the system > Privileged access > Options :
Import rule events that launch interface programs
Option Description
IMPORT RULE TRIAL RUN BEGIN An import rule trial starts.
IMPORT RULE TRIAL RUN END An import rule trial ends.
R e-e v aluating  import rules
Import rules are only run once on each discovered object. They are not re-run on objects that have
already been evaluated.
If the import rule changes, or if the attribut es  being used in an import rule are changed, then the import
rule is re-evaluated against the discovered objects. You can also manually re-evaluate an import rule by
clicking Update on the Import rules <rule type > page. This resets the rule and re-evaluates all discovered
objects.
Discovered objects can be re-evaluated manually through the import rules test page or when changes are
detected during an auto discovery . Local service mode discovered objects can also be re-evaluated when
they connect to the Bravura Security Fabric  server after  it has detected a change in an attribut e  used by
an import rule.
The behavior when r e-e v aluating  import rules is diff er en t  for each rule type:
▪Target systems import rules  (on page 2127) ▪
▪Managed systems import rules  (on page 2128) ▪
▪Managed accounts import rules  (on page 2128) ▪
Target systems import rules
Discovered systems that satis f y  Target systems import rules and become managed systems are not re-
evaluated by any import rules, regardless of changes to the managed systems or import rules.
To modify the settings  for a managed system, you can:
▪Click Manage the System > Resources > Target systems  > Aut omatic ally  discovered and manually ▪
change settings.
Or,
▪Delete the target system (manually or with an import rule), then re-evaluate it.▪Managed systems import rules
Managed system import rules are re-evaluated against managed systems whenever a change is detected
in the managed system during auto discovery , or when the import rules have changed.
If a change is made to a managed system that causes the system to fail the import rule, depending on the
c on figur ation  of the managed system import rule, it may archive the system. If there are managed
accounts on this system, the password changes no longer occur, but regular users can still request access
to these accounts, and product administrator  s can still access them.
Managed accounts import rules
Managed accounts import rules are re-evaluated against discovered accounts whenever a change is
detected:
▪In the accounts during auto discovery ▪
▪In member system attribut es  that were used to de fine  c onditions ▪
▪In the import rules, such as:▪
▪Services, tasks, IIS, or DCOM objects that have been added, removed, or set up for use by a new▪
user
▪ Modific ations  to attribut es  that are being used by managed accounts import rules ▪
▪ Modific ations  to c onditions  and associated policies on managed accounts import rules ▪
All accounts managed by a managed system policy are evaluated, including discovered accounts that
were manually added to the policy and those added to the policy by an import rule.
If a change is made to a managed account that causes the account to fail the import rule, depending on
the c on figur ation  of the managed account import rule, it may archive the account. If this account’s
password is being managed, the password changes no longer occur, but regular users can still request
access to this account, and product administrator  s can still access it. If the managed system is removed
from the policy the system’s managed account passwords are archived.Part III Bravura Privilege P atternPrivilege P attern:  Overview
Businesses often  struggle with how to create an authentic ation  w orkflo w  that will control which
passwords are granted to users after  c ollecting  approval from account holders. Main challenges include:
▪ Specific  accounts or users may not require any authoriz ation  at all whereas others will. ▪
▪ Diff er en t  users may require diff er en t  permissions towards accounts, such as having the ability to reset ▪
an account password or only having the ability to request a password.
▪Management of employees being given access to specific  accounts requires easy c ommunic ation  with ▪
privileged account owners that can be easily traced.
The Bravura Privilege P attern  deploys a team-based management and access model. This means that
every resource within Bravura Privilege  is managed by a team and all users’ access to those resources are
governed by the teams that they are assigned privileges in.
Teams
Team management in Bravura Privilege P attern  delegates onboarding of systems and accounts and
de finition  of access control rules to business stake-holders.
Team management is constructed around a number of concepts:
▪A team may represent a group of people, an applic ation  or an or g aniz ational  unit. ▪
▪Teams contain:▪
▪Managed systems  with which Bravura Privilege  is integrated. ▪
▪Managed accounts  that appear on managed systems and whose passwords Bravura Privilege  may ▪
set.
▪Team groups  used to assign privileges to Bravura Privilege  users. ▪
▪Team groups contain:▪
▪Privileges  such as trustee, approver, requester. See Privileges and appropriate users for more. ▪
▪Individual Bravura Privilege  users . ▪
▪Managed groups A managed group is a group of accounts de fined  on a target system, such as AD ▪
or LDAP , whose membership is monitored and managed in Bravura Security Fabric . On some target
systems this can include groups inside groups.
▪Team vaults Used to store and retrieve cr edentials  for target systems that do not communicate with ▪
Bravura Security Fabric  or other secrets (ie. a safe's c ombination).  They are not intended to set or
randomize cr edentials  stored within them. Team vaults contain:
▪System vaults R epr esen t ations  of systems in the environment, but without a connector or ▪
technical in t egr ation.
▪Vault accounts R epr esen t ations  of accounts on system vaults, along with stored (but not activ ely ▪
managed) passwords.
▪Proxy zone A set of Bravura Security Fabric  proxy servers responsible for running connectors that ▪
communicate with a set of systems, typically in the same loc ation  or on the same network segment.
This is typically required when direct c onnection  is blocked by a fir e w all. Bravura Privilege  may also
