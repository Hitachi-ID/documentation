-delete Remove the user’s product administrator rights.
-disable Disable the user.
-enable Enable the user.
-unlock Unlock the user.
-ipmask <IP/CIDRmask> Specify, in Classless Inter-Domain R outing  (CIDR)
not ation,  the IP addresses from which the user is allowed
to connect to the Bravura Security Fabric  API.
Use this argument if the user has either of the IDAPI
caller or OTP IDAPI caller rights.
For more in f ormation  about CIDR refer to the link below.
-name "<full name>" Set the full name of the product administrator.
If the user is an e xisting  user whose full name is stored in
Bravura Security Fabric , you do not need to type a full
name.Argument Description
-noexpire Set the password to not expire.
This argument applies only to product administrators
whose passwords are stored in the Bravura Security
Fabric  database.
-nooverwrite Do not set an e xisting  password.
-pass <password> Set the password of the product administrator.
Use this argument if you want the user to authentic a t e
using a password stored in Bravura Security Fabric . A
password is only required if the user does not have any
accounts; that is, you are cr eating  a console-only user.
-nopass Prevent the user from authentic ating  remotely.
-type A Grant the user all possible adminis tr ativ e  privileges. This
overrides the -acl argument.
-user <pr ofile  ID> The product administrator’s pr ofile  ID.
Type an e xisting  user’s pr ofile  ID if you want to grant or
modify his or her adminis tr ativ e  privileges or pr ofile
status.
Type the pr ofile  ID of a non-existent user if you want to
create a new Bravura Security Fabric  user, similar to the
superuser, that only performs adminis tr ativ e  tasks
(console-only access). Users created this way are not
mapped to accounts on target systems, and cannot
access any of the self-service modules.
CIDR not ation
See more in f ormation  on CIDR not ation
The purpose of the IP addresses field  is to identif y  specific  external server(s) that are allowed to access
the Bravura Security Fabric  server within the boundaries of the specified  access rights. This is
accomplished by using Classless Inter-Domain R outing  (CIDR) not ation  to de fine  an IP address block. The
address block is represented by an IP address and a pr e fix  size and is written  in slash not ation  <IP>/
<pr e fix>  where:
▪IP is the IPv4 (<0-255>.<0-255>.<0-255>.<0-255>) or IPv6 address (<0000- ff ff>:<0000- ff ff>:<0000- ▪
ff ff>:<0000- ff ff>:<0000- ff ff>:<0000- ff ff>:<0000- ff ff>:<0000- ff ff>)
▪ pr e fix  is the pr e fix  size for the mask and must be an integer within the range 0-32 for IPv4 or 0-128 for ▪
IPv6
The subnet mask determines the size of the address block (the number of IP addresses belonging to the
block), and used in c onjunction  with the IP address, specifies  which particular  IP addresses belong to that
block. Some planning is required. You need to determine whether the entry is going to be used to
represent a single address or a range of c onsecutiv e  addresses.
The size of the address block, or the number of IP addresses that the block contains isnumber of entries = 2(32- < subnetmask > )
To determine the IP addresses of the servers that will be granted access to the Bravura Security Fabric
server from the IP address/subnet entry do the following:
1.Turn the IP address into binary not ation;  for example, 1.
▪128.10.12.1 = 10000000.00001010.00001100.00000001▪
2.Start at the left hand side of the binary r epr esen t ation  and mark off the number of binary digits 2.
specified  by the subnet mask; for example, using a 30 bit subnet mask, the fir s t 30 digits are marked
off (bolded).
▪10000000.00001010.00001100.000000 01 ▪
Valid or matching IP addresses must be based on these fir s t 30 digits.
3.Calculate the valid addresses by cr eating  all possible permut ations  using the remaining binary digits. 3.
In this case, there are only two unmasked digits, and as a result there are only 2(32 - 30)= 22= 4
possible addresses that match.
▪10000000.00001010.00001100.000000 00 = 128.10.12.0 ▪
▪10000000.00001010.00001100.000000 01 = 128.10.12.1 ▪
▪10000000.00001010.00001100.000000 10 = 128.10.12.2 ▪
▪10000000.00001010.00001100.000000 11 = 128.10.12.3 ▪
To restrict access to a single server use a complete pr e fix  (32 for IPv4 or 128 for IPv6). This means that
the IP address must match exactly.
To restrict access only to processes (servers) that reside on the Bravura Security Fabric  server, use the
local host address with a complete pr e fix  (127.0.0.1/32 or ::1/128 for IPv4 and IPv6 r espectiv ely).
External access will be denied.

3.To create a console-only user that can access the API Service (idapi), type:3.
adm_set -user APIUser1 -pass 5*Epxag1 -acl apicaller -

4.To unlock the default superuser after  too many failed login attemp ts,  type: 4.
