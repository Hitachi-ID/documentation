addition.Session monitor app
Regular users, with appropriate permissions, use the Session monitor app to request and download
recorded sessions of activity  requiring privileged cr edentials.  They may be able to access recorded data
related to their own or another users’ activity .
Options  plugin
You can use a plugin to activ a t e  session monitoring based on the requester, privileged account, or system,
and override policy settings.  The input into the plugin can include the:
▪Requester’s pr ofile  ID ▪
▪Requester’s group memberships▪
▪Requester’s pr ofile  attribut es ▪
▪Requested account▪
▪Managed system▪
▪Managed system’s attribut es ▪
If enabled, the plugin is called when a user checks out privileged access or a product administrator  accesses
a password directly. This applies only to disclosure methods that support session monitoring. The output
of the plugin contains session monitoring settings  that override managed system policy settings.
You enable this plugin by typing the name of the program or script in the SMON OPTIONS PLUGIN field
on the Manage the system  > Modules  > Session monitor  page.
Some data is not input by default. You must manually enable certain registry settings  to allow the plugin
to receive this in f ormation.
Ensure that you are comfortable and knowledgeable in the mechanics of the registry before you attemp t
to change any c onfiguration  settings.  Contact support@bravurasecurity.com  if in doubt.

Recorded session file storage
The session monitoring batch processing utility ,  smonprocessmeta , runs periodically while a session
monitoring session is activ e  to process harvested data and insert the data into the database in a series of
batch oper ations.  The smonsavemeta  program creates session data packages when requested.
The following Manage the system  > Modules  > Session monitor  options  control where files are placed
during and after  processing:Option Description
SMON DAMAGED EVENT STORAGE
ENABLEDIf enabled, damaged events are stored on the file system. If disabled,
they are dropped.
This is useful, for example, if you are debugging problems with session
recording. It is recommended that you disable this for normal
functioning.
SMON DAMAGED EVENT STORAGE
PATHDirectory to store damaged events for recorded sessions (default <install
path>\smon\damaged).
SMON HCP TARGET ID Specify the target system ID of the Hitachi Content Platform  object
storage system to archive session monitoring data.
SMON PACKAGE STORAGE PATH Directory to store packages of recorded sessions (default <install path>
\smon\package).
SMON SCREENSHOT STORAGE PATH Directory to store screenshot data for recorded sessions (default <install
path>\smon\screenshot).
SMON TEMP STORAGE PATH Directory to store temporary files while g ener ating  recorded session
packages (default <install path>\smon\temp).
SMON TEXT STORAGE PATH Directory to store text data w aiting  to be processed for recorded
sessions (default <install path>\smon\text).
SMON WEBCAM STORAGE PATH Directory to store webcam images for recorded sessions (default <install
path>\smon\webcam).
Recorded session search controls
The Session monitor  app uses a powerful search engine to search recorded UI, clipboard, and keystroke
data. You control the following options  for the search engine in the Manage the system > Modules >
Session monitor  menu:
Option Description
SMON SEARCH ENGINE
CHARACTERS TO IGNORECharacters that the SMON module search engine
will ignore.
SMON SEARCH ENGINE WORD
DELIMITERSCharacters that the SMON module search engine
will treat as word delimiters.
SMON SEARCH ENGINE WORD MIN
LENGTHThe minimum length of words that will be indexed
and searchable by the SMON search engine.
These settings  de fine  what is considered a ’word’ and loaded into the database. The settings  are used in
the following order:
1.SMON SEARCH ENGINE WORD DELIMITERS split the stream of in f ormation  into blocks of characters. 1.
2.The characters in SMON SEARCH ENGINE CHARACTERS TO IGNORE are removed. 2.
3.If the number of characters in the block is greater than or equal to SMON SEARCH ENGINE WORD 3.
MIN LENGTH , then the block is loaded to be search.If these settings  above are changed, only new sessions will be a ff ect ed.  Existing  words that are loaded
will need to be used to search for matching sessions.
These settings  are also applied to the Session matching contents field  on the Search all recorded data
page.
The following are examples of how the settings  would be applied:

Recorded session video processing
Bravura Security Fabric  runs the smonavi or another video g ener ation  program to create video files for
recorded session packages. Screenshots are aggregated into hour-long video segments.
The following Manage the system  > Modules  > Session monitor  options  control video cr eation:
Option Description
SMON VIDEO CREATE CODEC CODE Four character code that indicates what codec is used for video
g ener ation.  The default is Micr osoft  Video 1 Codec (msvc).
Note:  Use the default for t esting  only. Replace it with a codec that
provides better  quality video. To see what other codecs you have
available, run the smonavi utility  with the -l argument.
SMON VIDEO CREATE COMMAND
LINECommand line used to launch a program to create video from
screenshots captured during a recorded session. The default command
is smonavi.exe -r%fps% -i %pattern%_*.png  -f %path% -c %codec%.
SMON VIDEO CREATE FILE EXT File extension to be used for created videos. By default, AVI video files
are created.
Note:  The smonavi utility  can only generate AVI video files.  You must
specify a third party program in SMON VIDEO CREATE COMMAND LINE
to generate other video file types, such as WMV, MP4, and MOV.
The default command de fined  by the SMON VIDEO CREATE COMMAND LINE is:
smonavi.exe -r %fps% -i %pattern%_*.png -f %path% -c %codec%
Where:
▪%fps  is the frames per second at which the session was recorded. ▪
▪%pattern  is the start of the file names that will be consistent for all images in a single video. ▪
This allows smonavi to determine which images came from what display when multiple  displays are
used.▪%path  is a loc ation  in the directory specified  by SMON TEMP STORAGE PATH in the Manage the ▪
system > Modules > Recorded session management  (SMON) menu.
▪%codec%  is replaced by the value of SMON VIDEO CREATE CODEC CODE in the Manage the system ▪
> Modules > Recorded session management  (SMON ) menu.
The msvc codec is recommended for t esting  only. To see what other codecs you have available, run
the smonavi utility  with the -l argument.
Alt ernativ ely  you can specify a third party program; for example:
ffmpeg.e x e  -r %fps% -i %pattern%_%09d.png  %path% 
If you specify another program, you can match the argument variables with the utilities  expected
command line. For example, the following two programs require diff er en t  input values for the images to
be used to make the video:
▪ ffmpeg:  %pattern%_%09d.png ▪
The _%09.png is a special text string that ffmpeg  wants appended on the end of the input files so it
can locate input files.
▪smonavi: %pattern%_*.png ▪
smonavi uses a * to indicate that it wants all files that start with %pattern% and ends with
_*.png at the end.

smonavi  usage in f ormation
The smonsavemeta program triggers smonavi to create hour-long AVI video files from the re-
generated screenshots. You can control the output, or choose to use another video cr eation  program
such as ffmpeg ,  by changing the value of SMON VIDEO CREATE COMMAND LINE in the Manage the
system > Modules > Recorded session management (smon)  menu.
You can run smonavi with the -l argument from the command line to get a list of the codecs available
on the system. The smonavi program prints a + symbol next to codecs that can be used to create
video from screenshots captured during a recorded session; it prints a - symbol next to installed codecs
that are not c ompatible.  If none of the e xisting  codecs can be used, it is recommended that you install
additional  codecs.
Usage
smonavi.exe -l
smonavi.exe -r <frames per second rate>  -i <image name pattern>  -
f <output file>  -c <codec code>
Argument Description
-c Code of codec to use. This must be a 4-character code
that is in the list of available codecs returned with the -l
option.
-f <file> Output file name
