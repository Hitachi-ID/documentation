.T r oubleshooting
The following sections  contain in f ormation  about how to troubleshoot common problems, usually related
to improper ins t allation,  encountered during Phone Password Manager deployments.
Consult your vendor for additional  tr oubleshooting  in f ormation  regarding your voice board, associated
drivers, System Release softw ar e,  or PBX.
Problems with the voice board
If you run into problems with your voice board:
▪Check for IRQ c on flicts. ▪
One of the most common issues encountered when using voice boards is an IRQ c on flict.  Voice boards
work best when c on figur ed  with their own, high-priority, IRQ.
▪Ensure that you are using the right type of phone line.▪
Only analog lines can be used with analog boards, and only digital lines can be used with digital
boards. Plugging in the wrong type of line can damage the voice board.
▪Check your PBX documen t ation  to ensure that the board you purchased is c ompatible  with your PBX. ▪
▪Ensure that the voice board is able to pick up calls.▪
You can use the Intel � voice demo to do this.
Problems with hangup events
If Phone Password Manager is having problems with hangup events on a digital network system, and you
have correctly completed all c on figur ation  steps outlined in this manual, then there is probably a
misc on figur ation  on the Dialogic card. This problem should not happen on digital network systems. If it is
happening, contact the support department of your Dialogic hardware supply company, or purchase
support services from a third-party company.
If Phone Password Manager is having problems with hangup events, and the Dialogic card is connected
with analog CO lines or analog PBX lines:
▪Enable the "circuit reverse" or "batter y  reverse" features on those lines. This can off er  more reliable ▪
disconnect supervision.
▪If "circuit reverse" is not available, use the PBXpert to detect and enable tones for the analog Dialogic▪
card. For further details, see your Dialogic manual.
Welcome message does not play
If you hear dead air instead of the welcome message, then upgrade to the latest Dialogic System Release
Softw ar e  Updates. This issue can also be caused by improper audio file c on figur ation.Some or all audio files  are not playing
If no sound is played to users who connect, or there are certain menu options  for which the sound files
are not being played, it is possible that your audio file c on figur ation  is incorrect. Phone Password
Manager organizes audio files in the following directory structure:
<Instance>\audio\
▪en-us▪
▪a.wav▪
▪b.wav▪
▪(etc)▪
▪<Language code>▪
▪(Other languages)▪
If this directory structure is disturbed, or any of the audio files themselves are missing, then the system
will not be able to locate those files for playback to the user. This error can be easily diagnosed by
reviewing the system logs, which will include a message such as:
Warning: Cannot open C:\Program Files (x86)\Bravura Security\Telephone Password Manag er
\<ins t ance>\audio\en-us\<filename>. w a v ,  errno: 2
This error indicates that Phone Password Manager was unable to locate the audio files in their usual
directory.
Asterisk® audio files
When using an Asterisk®  server, Phone Password Manager needs to upload the locally-stored audio files
onto the Asterisk®  server. Phone Password Manager will only initia t e  this file s ynchr oniz ation  if it cannot
find the following directory on the Asterisk®  server:
\var\lib\asterisk\sounds\HiTPM\
To force Phone Password Manager to update the Asterisk®  server’s audio files:  delete the directory listed
above, restart the Phone Password Manager service, and place a call to the IVR.
