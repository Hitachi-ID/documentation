The following mechanisms are used to manage SSH public keys:
▪Auto-discovery of SSH public keys and authorized keys for accounts on Unix servers.▪
▪Connector oper ations  for SSH public key injection  and removal. ▪
▪Default access disclosure plugin for c onnecting  to the server using SSH keys. ▪
▪Check-out and check-in failure retries if servers cannot be reached.▪
The above are used when Unix managed systems are integrated with Bravura Privilege  in ”push mode”.
You can select accounts to be used for accessing files or running commands on a Unix server. Users can
check out these accounts using their SSH pubic key. This means that at check-out time,  their public key is
added to the server and at check-in time,  their public key is removed.
Users must have their SSH public keys in their profile  when using SSH keys to check out accounts.Use case: SSH key access
This use case demonstrates how to set up and check out an SSH key.

This use case assumes that:
▪The target system is Unix oper ating  system (Linux, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX are supported) ▪
▪OpenSSH installed is installed on the target system▪
▪The use case environment details are:▪
▪A linux system with hostname linux01 . ▪

Cr eating  SSH Key pairs
The following steps are based on a CentOS 7 64-bit server with OpenSSH pre-installed. The steps may
vary depending on which linux dis tributions  you decide to use.
More in f ormation  about OpenSSH: http s://w w w .ssh.c om/ ac adem y/ ssh/k e y g en
1.SSH into the linux system as root and enter its password: 1.
ssh root@linux01
2.Create 2 users: admin1 and sshkeyaccount using the useradd command: 2.
useradd admin1
useradd sshkeyaccount
3.Set a password for the accounts using the passwd command: 3.
passwd admin1
passwd sshkeyaccount
4.SSH into linux01 as admin1 and enter its password: 4.
ssh admin1@linux015.Create an SSH key pair using ssh -keygen . Accept all defaults. 5.
ssh-keygen
This saves the keys into the user’s .ssh directory.
6.End the SSH session for admin1.6.
7.SSH into linux01 as sshkeyaccount and enter its password: 7.
ssh sshkeyaccount@linux01
8.Create an SSH key pair using ssh-keygen. Accept all defaults.8.
ssh-keygen
This saves the keys into the user’s .ssh directory.
9.End the SSH session for sshkeyaccount . 9.
If you provide a passphrase for the ssh key, this will also need to be specified  upon SSH key account
check out, even when a password is not required.

Launch SSH using PuTTY over SSH disclosure
In order to use the PuTTY over SSH (using SSH keys) access disclosure plugin, additional  c on figur ation  will
need to be done, including:
▪Installing PuTTY on the client w ork s t ation  that will launch the disclosure. ▪
▪Adding the requester’s private key on the w ork s t ation. ▪
▪(If Session Monitor is c on figur ed)  Con figur e  SMON HTTP URL system variable. See Session Monitoring ▪
section  in the c on fig  doc on how to do this.
1.On the client w ork s t ation  that will launch the PuTTY over SSH disclosure, download and install PuTTY . 1.
This can be found at http s://w w w .putty .or g /
2.Ensure PuTTY can be run by opening up a command prompt window and typing ‘putty ’ .  If it does not 2.
resolve properly, add the full path to PuTTY to your PATH environment variables.
3.Copy over the foreign key of admin1 from linux01 (ie. id_rsa or id_dsa) to the client w ork s t ation.  This 3.
can be found in the .ssh directory.
4.Use the puttygen utility ,  found in C:\Program Files\PuTTY , utility  to generate a .ppk private key file 4.
from the foreign key:
a.Click Loada.
b.Locate and select the foreign key file b.
The key should now be loaded into puttygenc. (Optional)  Provide a passphrase for the ssh key c.
d.Save the private key file in a local directory d.
5.Double-click on the .ppk file. Pageant (PuTTY authentic ation  agent) will launch and load the private 5.
key file. You should see the icon of the Pageant program in the taskbar.

without pr ompting  for password
If you specified  a passphrase for the ssh key, you will be prompted to provide one, even if a password
is not required.Check in SSH key access
After  checking in a SSH key account, the requester should no longer be able to ssh into the managed
account without a password.
1.Log in to the Front-end  as admin1 1.
2.Click Privileged access 2.
3.Under Check-outs, click Mine filt er  from the left panel 3.
4.Select sshkeyaccount4.
5.Click Check in 5.
