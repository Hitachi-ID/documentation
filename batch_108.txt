Role app
Bravura Security Fabric  12.0.0 introduced an experimental Role app  to request role membership and role
c on figur ation  changes. This feature is disabled by default (via the ROLE APP option).
Con figuring  search
Modify the number of search results per page
By default, Bravura Security Fabric  will provide the choice of 10,20,50 or 100 search records per page.
You can change the default list by modifying RECORDS PER PAGE LIST . There is a minimum of 2 and a
maximum of 500 records per page.
Download search results
You can c on figur e  a plugin program to allow the in f ormation  from a search results page to be available
for download.The plugin, set by the SEARCH DOWNLOAD PLUGIN field,  can be called to determine if a download link is
available to a user on the search results page, or provide the content of a file for download.
The built-in plugin, plugin-download-csv.exe , allows any user to download user search results
and external data store tables as CSV files,  given that they have permission to access those pages.
This plugin is not enabled by default.

Requirements
See W riting  plugins  for general requirements.
Ex ecution  points
This plugin is called by the View and update pr ofile  (IDR) module and the Manage external data store  external
data store (DBE) module. It is called once when the user list or the table is displayed to decide whether to
display the download link. It is called again when the user clicks the download link.
Displaying the download link
When enabled by the plugin, a download link or button  is displayed:
Below the user search results
Below an Manage external data store  (DBE) module table
Input
The input presented to the plugin during the initial  call includes the viewer in f ormation,  plugin mode,
module, and search type.
    "" "" = {
        "sessionid" = "<session GUID>" # The user session
        "queryMode" = "displayDownloadButton"
        "module" = "<module>" # The module calling the plugin, such as idr.
        "searchType" = "<type>" # The search type such as user or which table.
        "viewer" "user" = {
            "id" = "<Profile ID>"
            "name" = "<Alias>"
            "acl" "" = {
              "<list of acls the user has>"
            }
        }
    }
OutputThe plugin can provide the option  to display a download link. If the option  returned is true, a download
link is available to the user to download file.
    "" "" = {
        "displayDownloadButton" = "<true|false>"
    }
Returning a file
When called in stream mode, the plugin will be sent a KVGroup providing the stream mode, search type
and viewer. If a search query was used to limit the results being downloaded, that is also provided.
    "" "" = {
        "queryMode" = "streamResults"
        "module" = "<module>" # The module calling the plugin, such as idr.
        "searchType" = "<type>" # The search type such as user or which table.
        "searchQuery" = "<query>"
        "viewer" "user" = {
            "id" = "<Profile ID>"
            "name" = "<Alias>"
            "acl" "" = {
              "<list of acls the user has>"
            }
        }
    }
The plugin must then return in f ormation  on the suggested filename  and content type.
    "" "" = {
        "contentType" = "<MIME type>" # The mime type being streamed such as text/
plin
        "filename" = "<text>" # The suggested file name being returned.
    }
The plugin will then recieve a KVGroup for each of the items in the search results.
Example:
    "" "" = {
        "id" = "<Profile ID>"
        "name" = "<Alias>"
    }
Any output provided by the plugin following the KVGroup with filename  and content type, will be
streamed to the client directly.
.Limit search results
You can limit the number of results returned for a search by c on figuring  SEARCHMAX RESULTS . This
forces users to be more specific  in their search criteria. By default SEARCH MAX RESULTS is set to 10,000,
which means that only the fir s t 10,000 matches are displayed. If there are more matches than this value,
Bravura Security Fabric  warns users to r e fine  their search criteria.
This value must be set to 100 or more.
Filtering search results
You can c on figur e  a plugin program to filt er  search results based on the type of search engine. You can
use this plugin to set up some search criteria for an engine so that only search results that satis f y  the
criteria will be visible to the user.
To enable this plugin:
1.Click Manage the system > Modules > Options . 1.
2.Type the name of the plugin in the SEARCH FILTER PLUGIN  field. 2.
3.Type a comma-delimited list of engines from which to call the plugin in SEARCH FILTER PLUGIN 3.
