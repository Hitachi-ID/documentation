Password Manager Service c on figur ation  (idpm)
The pushpass file is used to c on figur e  the Password Manager service (idpm). The options  are as
follows:
▪ t ar g etid  If you are using aliasing, this option  is used to specify the ID of the target. ▪
Example:
        targetid = "UNIXSERVER";
▪hostname The hostname option  is used to specify the loc ation  of the Password Manager service ▪
service to be used by pspasswd. This can either be an IP address or a hostname.
Example:
        hostname = "UNIXSERVER";
▪port The port option  is used to specify the port that the Password Manager service is running on. The ▪
default value for the Password Manager service is 3333.
Example:
        port = "3333";
▪ timeout  Specifies  the timeout  (in seconds) that should be used when c ommunic ating  with Password ▪
Manager service. The default value is set to 10 seconds.
Example:
        timeout = "10" ;▪fail-if-unavailable Specifies  the action  to take if the password oper ation  fails and the Password ▪
Manager service cannot be contacted. The default behavior is to fail the oper ation  if the Password
Manager service is unavailable.
Example:

details.LDAP trigger
This chapter shows you how to set up transparent password s ynchr oniz ation  with an LDAP Directory
Service trigger system.
Before you begin, ensure that you have researched and carried out the steps outlined in Implementing
Transparent Password S ynchr oniz ation  (on page 1659).
Bravura Pass  can intercept password changes on Unix-based LDAP servers using a pre-change and post-
change strength filt er ,  psldap * 1.
You can install the LDAP password filt er  plugin ( psldap ) on the following Unix-based servers:
▪Sun ONE Directory Server (v5.x), Oracle DSEE and Red Hat Directory Server▪
▪OpenLDAP v2.2.x▪
▪IBM Directory Server▪
To set up transparent password s ynchr oniz ation  with an LDAP Directory Service trigger system:
1.Ensure that a c ompatible  version of OpenSSL (1.1.x) is installed on the LDAP system. 1.
2.Install the LDAP password filt er  plugin. 2.
3. Con figur e  the Password Manager ( idpm ) service. 3.
4. Con figur e  your LDAP ins t allation  to use the plugin. 4.
5. Optional:  Filter password change requests to include certain users, groups and domains. 5.
These steps are detailed in the following sections.
WARNING! Ensure that your LDAP client does not hash new passwords before
sending requests to the LDAP server. If you do not want passwords to be
tr ansmitted  in plaintext, it is highly recommended that you enable SSL on
the LDAP server.
Installing the LDAP password filt er  plugin
To install the LDAP password filt er  plugin (psldap) on a Unix-based LDAP server:
1.If you did not select Unix Ins t allation  Packages  when you installed the Connector Pack, run setup on 1.
the Bravura Security Fabric  server to modify your Connector Pack ins t allation.
Ensure that appropriate Unix package is selected on the component selection  page.
Click Next , then complete the ins t allation  procedure.
See Install the psunix ins t allation  package  (on page 1707) for more detail.
2.Copy the psunix-<os>.<cpu>.tar.gz  file from the unix directory to a scratch directory (such 2.
as /tmp) on the Unix server.
3.Log into the LDAP server with adminis tr ativ e  privileges, and extract the files from the psunix 3.
archive.For example, type:  
   cd /tmp 
   tar -zxvf psunix-linux-glibc-2.28.x64.tar.gz  
4.Run install.sh  and select LDAP Transparent Synch  option. 4.
   sh install.sh [ -inf <path>/idmsetup.inf ]  
5.Follow the ins tructions  displayed by the installer script. 5.
In the ins t allation  process, follow the ins tructions  and input the in f ormation  prompted by each input
field.  To skip a field,  press [Enter]  to use the default value.
6.Verify that the following shared object files are copied to /usr/local/psunix/default/. 6.
The psldap * shared object files are named using the format:
psldap-<ldap-type>.so
Where the <ldap-type> is:
▪sunldap if you are running Oracle DSEE, Sun ONE Directory Server, or Red Hat Directory Server ▪
▪openldap if you are running OpenLDAP ▪
▪ibmldap if you are running IBM Directory Server ▪
7.Ensure that the psunix folder and all files and plugins inside are readable and executable. 7.
For example, run the following commands: 
     chmod -R a+rx /usr/local/psunix/ 
     chmod a+rx /usr/local/psunix/default/psldap-openldap.so  
8.Also ensure that /etc/psunix.cfg  and /etc/psunix.d/  have read and execute permissions: 8.
     chmod a+rx /etc/psunix.cfg 
     chmod -R a+rx /etc/psunix.d/  
9.Stop the LDAP service.9.
10. Start the LDAP service. 10.
Con figuring  the Password Manager service for transparent s ynchr oniz ation
To allow external servers access to the Password Manager service  (on page 2820) (idpm) on the primary
Bravura Security Fabric  server you must also add a CIDR mask address for the trigger system.
1.Click Manage the system > Maintenance > Services . 1.
2.Select Bravura Security (idpm) Password Manager Service . 2.
3.Add a CIDR mask address for the trigger system in the following setting: 3.

Filtering password change requests on a LDAP Directory Service trigger system
You can c on figur e  the LDAP password s ynchr oniz ation  to include certain users, groups, and domains
when they make password change requests on LDAP Directory Service trigger systems.
To c on figur e  the user filt er s:
1.Modify the psldap c on figur ation  file in /usr/local/psunix/default/psunix.d/ . 1.
2.Uncomment the following lines:  2.
      #    filter-dn-include = { 
      #       "ou=finance,dc=example,dc=com";       #       "ou=hr,dc=example,dc=com"; 
      #    };  
3.Edit the filt er s  with specific  UIDs, OUs, and DCs to include in password change requests. 3.
Filters are in the following syntax: 
      "uid=<userid>,ou=Bravura Group,dc=<domain>,dc=<com>";  
Multiple  filt er s  can be used, with diff er en t  levels of specificity .  Users that pass any one of the filt er s
will be included in password change requests.
For example: 
      filter-dn-include = { 
         "dc=mydomain,dc=net"; 
         "ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"; 
         "uid=testuser,ou=finance,dc=example,dc=com"; 
      };  
4.Save the file and restart the LDAP service. 4.2The actual name of the filt er  varies depending on the target system type. See the appropriate section  for
details.OID-LDAP trigger
This chapter shows you how to set up transparent password s ynchr oniz ation  for an Oracle Internet
Directory LDAP (OID-LDAP) trigger system.
Before you begin, ensure that you have researched and carried out the steps outlined in Implementing
Transparent Password S ynchr oniz ation  (on page 1659).
Bravura Pass  can intercept password changes on OID-LDAP trigger systems using a pre-change and post-
change strength filt er ,  psldap*  2 for:
Unix-based OID-LDAP servers
Before you start, you should have the encrypted c ommunic ation  key (COMMKEY), or a copy of the
idmsetup.inf  c on figur ation  file. The idmsetup.inf c on figur ation  file is located on the Bravura
Security Fabric  server in the p sc on fig  directory.
To install the OID-LDAP password filt er  plugin (psldap.so) on a Unix-based OID-LDAP server:
1.If you did not select Unix Ins t allation  Packages  when you installed the Connector Pack, run setup on 1.
the Bravura Security Fabric  server to modify your Connector Pack ins t allation.
Ensure that the appropriate Unix package is selected on the component selection  page. Click Next ,
then complete the ins t allation  procedure.
2.Copy the psunix-<os>.<cpu>.tar.gz file from the unix directory to a scratch directory (such 2.
as /tmp) on the OID-LDAP server.
3.Log into the LDAP server with adminis tr ativ e  privileges, and extract the files from the psunix archive. 3.
For example, type:  
   cd /tmp 
   tar -zxvf psunix-solaris9.sparc64.tar.gz  
4.Run install.sh and select LDAP Transparent Synch option.   4.
   sh install.sh -c 4 [ -inf <path>/idmsetup.inf ]  
5.Follow the ins tructions  displayed by the installer script. 5.
In the c on figur ation  process, verify that the script correctly identifies  your oper ating  system type. If
not, override it.
In the ins t allation  process, follow the ins tructions  and input the in f ormation  prompted by each input
field.  To skip a field,  press [Enter]  to use the default value.
6.Verify that the psldap-oidldap.so  shared object file is copied to /usr/local/psunix/default/. 6.
7.Ensure that /etc/psunix.cfg  and / etc/psunix.d/ c on figur ation  files are readable by the 7.
Oracle account:  
   chmod a+rx /etc/psunix.cfg 
   chmod -R a+rx /etc/psunix.d  
8.Stop the OID-LDAP Applic ation  Server. 8.9.Copy the psldap-oidldap.so file from the /usr/local/psunix/default/ directory to: $ORACLE_HOME/lib 9.
on the database server as psldap.so. You can place this binary somewhere else, but you must edit files
in the next steps accordingly.
ORACLE_HOME is the destination  directory specified  during the Oracle Applic ation  Server
Infrastructure ins t allation.
For example: 
     cp /usr/local/psunix/default/psldap-oidldap.so u01/app/
oracle/lib/psldap.so  
10. Edit the listener.ora file in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin to permit access to the shared object. 10.
Add the path to the library to the oracle environment variable EXTPROC_DLLS. This must match the
path to the psldap.so  binary.
For example:
  SID_LIST_LISTENER = 
    (SID_LIST = 
      (SID_DESC = 
        (SID_NAME = PLSExtProc) 
        (ORACLE_HOME = /u01/app/oracle) 
        (PROGRAM = extproc) 
        (ENVS="EXTPROC_DLLS=/u01/app/oracle/lib/psldap.so") 
      ) 
    )
11. Edit psldap-oidldap-plugin.sql, in the psunix-<os>.<cpu>/addon/transparent-synch/ldap directory to 11.
set the path to the library in the plugin. This must match the path to the psldap.so  binary.
For example:
  CREATE OR REPLACE LIBRARY psldap_lib AS 
  '/u01/app/oracle/lib/psldap.so'; 
  / 
  SHOW ERRORS
12. Install psldap-oidldap-plugin.sql. This file contains stored procedures needed for the plugin. You can 12.
install it, for example, by e x ecuting  the command:  
  sqlplus ods/<odspassword> @<pathto psldap-oidldap-plugin.sql>  
on the database server, where ods is the OID Database Schema owner
For example: 
  $ORACLE_HOME/bin/sqlplus ods/mypass @psldap-oidldap-plugin.sql  
13. Set up the plugin in the LDAP server. This can be done either from the GUI by hand, or using the 13.
supplied pluginreg.dat. Using pluginreg.dat from the LDAP server, run the command:  
  ldapadd -p <portnum> -h <hostname> -D cn=orcladmin \ 
        -w <orcladminpassword> -v \ 
        -f <pathto psldap-oidldap-pluginreg.dat>
