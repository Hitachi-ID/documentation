T esting  batch notific ations
Bravura Security Fabric  uses the ntftrigger  program to communicate with the Notific ation  Service
and send out notific ations.  Scheduling a batch notific ation  creates a scheduled job to run ntftrigger .
You can use this program to test notific ations  rather than wait for the scheduled time.
To test batch notific ations,  on the Batch notific ation  in f ormation  page for a notific ation,  click the
Schedule tab, then select 
 Run now .

R es t arting  batch notific ations
To clear records of notific ations  sent for a particular  batch notific ation,  click Restart  at the bottom  of the
Batch notific ation  inf ormation  page.You may want to do this, for example, if you change the maximum number of messages to send or other
c on figur ation  settings.
Setting  pr e-c onditions
Once you have added a notific ation,  you can set any number of pr e-c onditions  for notif ying  users based
on e v aluating  user s t atistics  stored in the USERSTAT table or users’ membership in user classes. This may
improve performance by sending notific ations  to a subset of users.
To de fine  pr e-c onditions  based on user s t atistics:
1.On the Notific ation  in f ormation  page for a notific ation,  click the Pr e-c onditions  tab. 1.

%USERID% The Bravura Security Fabric  pr ofile  ID
%USERNAME% The user’s full name
%MGRID% The user ID of current user’s direct manager
%MGRNAME% The full name of current user’s direct manager
%MGREMAIL% The email of current user’s direct manager
%NREMIND% The number of notific ations  the user has received to date; for example,
This is notification %NREMIND% of 4.Option Description
Only available for password expiry compliance check
%DAYS% The number of days to password expiry; for example, Your password
will expire in %DAYS% days.
%EXPACCT% The account, whose password has expired or is about to expire, that
triggers notific ation;  for example,  JANEAD1/test000
%EXPACCTHOST% The target system of the account that triggered this notific ation
%EXPACCTLONGID% The name of the account that triggered this notific ation
%EXPTIME% The password expiry time  for the corresponding account in %EXPACCT%.

%USTATTAG% The USERSTAT tag that the compliance or batch plugin is using
%USTATVAL% The USERSTAT value for the user
Adding macros to messages
You can use M4macros that expand to text strings, in the language of the user, in notific ation  messages.
The macros can include HTML code to enhance the display of message content. The M4 system and
requirements are detailed in the CUSTOMIZATION  (on page 3471).
The p sntfs v c.m4  file in <Program Files path>\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\<instance>\ design\src\z\
includes the following pr e-de fined  macros:
Macro tag name English text
EXPIRY_NONCOMP_MSG Your password will expire in [%DAYS%] days.
EXPIRY_THANKS_MSG Thank-you for changing your password.
EXPIRY_ACTION_MSG You have exceeded the maximum number of reminders
for this notific ation,  no further reminders will be sent.
QAREG_NONCOMP_MSG You have not completed your question  & answer
r egis tr ation.
QAREG_THANKS_MSG Thank-you for c ompleting  your question  & answer
r egis tr ation.
QAREG_ACTION_MSG You have exceeded the maximum number of reminders
for this notific ation,  no further reminders will be sent.
To use M4 macros, type the corresponding tag, beginning with !!!, in the relevant field  in the Con figur e
notific ation  plugins pages; for example:
!!!EXPIRY_NONCOMP_MSGAfter  you click Update, the Displayed value of the M4 macro is shown as it appears in the message sent
to users. You can use this to verify that you have entered the correct macro without triggering a
notific ation  message. For example, the tag shown in the example above has the following Displayed
value:
Your password will expire in [%DAYS%] days.
To learn how to:
▪Add HTML code to enhance the display of the message content, see Change the layout  (on page ▪
3496).
▪Modify the text de fined  by the m4 macros, see Altering text  (on page 3485). ▪
The message subject line for batch notific ations  can contain macros that expand to text, but you
cannot include HTML code in the subject.
Adding custom tags
To add customized messages to notific ation  plugin message fields:
1.Create psntfsvc.m4 in <instance>\design\\custom\ , if it does not already exist. 1.
2.Add lines to the custom file in the following format: 2.
!!!<MESSAGE_TAG>
<text>
where <text>  can include HTML code and M4 macros.
For example:
!!!SIMPLE_MESSAGE_TAG
Have a <strong>good</strong> day.
!!!TRANSLATABLE_MESSAGE
CUSTOM_MACRO_1
CUSTOM_MACRO_2
CUSTOM_MACRO_3
3.To de fine  text in multiple  languages, create the <lang >-<locale >-language.kvg file for each 3.
supported language in <DESIGN>\custom\ if it does not already exist.
4.Edit the macro de finitions  as required, in the format: 4.
 
"CUSTOM_MACRO_1" "" = { 
  "text" = "This is the first line of the message" 
} 
"CUSTOM_MACRO_2" "" = { 
  "text" = "... the second" 
} 
"CUSTOM_MACRO_3" "" = {   "text" = "...and the third.<br>Signed, your company" 
} 
5.In the relevant field  in the Manage the system  (PSA) module Con figur e  notific ation  plugins  pages, type 5.
the corresponding tag beginning with !!! from psntfsvc.m4 ; for example, in Message to display
to a non-compliant user for Set USERSTAT tag , type:
!!!TRANSLATABLE_MESSAGE
6.Recompile and install your skin (*.z) files by running make.bat in the design directory. 6.

Bravura Security Fabric  manages access on and authentic a t es  to shared computer systems, referred to as
target systems . Example target systems include oper ating  systems, databases, directories, and
applic ations.  Bravura Identity  also uses target systems to manage inventory objects.
Bravura Security Fabric  relies on softw ar e  components called connectors , which are installed with the
Connector Pack :
▪User management connectors, which can list users, manage accounts, groups, passwords, and other▪
objects on a target system
User management connectors may include:
▪An agent binary located in the Bravura Security Fabric  instances agent directory. product ▪
administrator s can use their process names to troubleshoot functionality  by finding  them in Bravura
Security Fabric  logs or the Windows’ list of running processes.
▪Any libraries used by the agent. This may include libraries in <Program Files>\Common Files▪
\Bravura Security\, Windows or VisualC++ libraries and the various target libraries, SDKs, Python
interpreter, and so on.
▪In some cases, such as Unix systems, a listener installed on the target system.▪
▪Ticket management connectors, also known as interface programs or exit trap programs, that can▪
trigger updates on target systems when certain events occur on the Bravura Security Fabric  server
Not all target systems are capable of supporting  all connector operations,  and some operations  are
not available through the Bravura Security Fabric web interface. See Connector operations  for a full
list and e xplanation  of each connector operation.
Bravura Security Fabric  can connect and support oper ations  on a target system when you register the
system using the Manage the system  (PSA) module. Optionally ,  you can register IT Service Management
(Ticket) systems to c on figur e  event actions.  The security bene fit  of registering IT Service Management
(Ticket) systems is that all sensitiv e  in f ormation  (server address, admin cr edentials)  is aut omatic ally
passed to the tick e t  management connector, rather than stored in a c on figur ation  file in plain text.
To add a target system to Bravura Security Fabric  (that is, to register it) you must provide the following
in f ormation:
▪The target system type▪
▪The target system description ▪
▪The target system address / c onnection  details ▪
▪target system administrator  cr edentials ▪
Additionally  you should modify the default c on figur ation  and policy settings  to match your target system
and business requirements. For example, you may want to designate the target system as a source of
pr ofile  IDs, or c on figur e  target-system-level authoriz ation.
Bravura Privilege can also add target systems using the auto discovery  process. During auto discovery , all
discovered systems are saved in the Manage the system  (PSA) module ( Manage the system > Resources >
