Team administrators
Team administrators are users that are responsible for cr eating ,  deleting  and managing group
memberships of teams. When cr eating  a team, a team administrator assigns trustees to the teams. Team
administrators and team trustees can both manage team group memberships, but once a trustee is
assigned, a team administrator will require permission from the team trustee to make changes. It is best
pr actice  not to allow team administrators to also be team trustees.
The team administrator role is generally given to a user within the company that is aware of how the
business is structured. The user may be a technical person that also functions  as a product administrator
for Bravura Privilege  or they may be more involved in the business oper ations  of the company.
Users must be a member of the PAM_TEAM_ADMINS user class to be team administrator and create and
delete teams.
Team trustees
Team trustees use Bravura Privilege to manage their assigned teams by controlling team group
membership and privileges. They are also responsible for onboarding and offboar ding  systems and
accounts to their teams.Users who are assigned as team trustees are aut omatic ally  added to the PAM_PRIV_TEAM user class to
gain access to the appropriate PDRs.
Do not add groups to the PAM_PRIV_TEAM user class.
Privileges and appropriate users
Within the team structure, team groups are created to assign privileges to. Team group members can be
assigned the following privileges:
▪Account trustee  A user who can onboard, offboar d,  and update privileged accounts. ▪
▪Approver  A user who can allow or disallow access requests. ▪
▪Approvers are also referred to as authorizers in the core Bravura Security Fabric  c on figur ation  and ▪
documen t ation.
▪Approvers are often  the owners of the managed account or an appropriate manager of the ▪
requester.
▪Auto_Approved  A user who can check-out access to systems and accounts without making an access ▪
request. These users must also have permission to request access.
▪Users that check out an account on a regular basis should be given the auto-approval privilege to▪
avoid holding up their work and to avoid approver f atigue.
▪ Cr edential_Manag e r A user who can override or randomize the stored password on a checked-out ▪
account. These users must also have the requesters privilege.
▪ Cr edential  manager privilege is often  given to the owners of the managed account. ▪
▪LC trustees  a user who can create and update vaulted cr edentials. ▪
▪OTP Trustees  a user who can create and use OTP accounts. ▪
▪Requester  A user who can make access requests. ▪
▪Requesters that require approvers are generally users that do not require access to the managed▪
account on a regular basis, but should still have access to the account in the event of an emergency
or a circumstance that arises on occasion.
▪Subscriber trustee  a user who can make subscriber v alidation  requests. ▪
▪System trustee  a user who can onboard, offboar d,  and update privileged systems. ▪
▪Team trustee a user who can make team management requests. ▪
▪Vault trustee  a user who can create, archive, and update vault systems and accounts. ▪Privilege P attern:  Ins t allation

Example: Installing Bravura Privilege P attern
In this example you will load, list, view and install Bravura Privilege P attern  components using the
Manage components app.
To install Bravura Privilege P attern  components:
1.Log in to the Front-end (PSF) as superuser  . 1.
2.Click Manage Components > RefBuild. 2.
3.Select RefBuild.pam_team_management . 3.
If the RefBuild.pam_team_management  component is not showing up, try clicking Reload DB
under the ACTIONS  header on the left panel.Click Install component(s) from the Actions  panel on the right.
The component management program installs the components along with any dependencies. This
may take some time  depending on c on figur ation  requirements and dependencies. You should see
Completed install for component  messages for each selected component in the TASK
STATUS section  of the Actions  panel.If the ins t allation  seems to by taking a very long time  or seems stuck, navigate back to the home page
and return to the Manage Components > RefBuild  page to see if the installed status for the
component has turned to true .When you install a component, the component management program creates the database tables,
framework, and c on figur ations  that are necessary for the plug-in points to function.  Additional  in-
product c on figur ation  may still be required to run the scenarios properly.
4.Take a look at some of the new c on figur ation  support the reference build components add to the 4.

Privilege P attern:  Team c on figur ation
Normally when you create a team, you are prompted to create custom team groups to assign privileges
to. To standardize your teams and save time  you can set up a global c on figur ation  for your teams so when
new ones are created you start off with the appropriate groups available with the correctly assigned
privileges. It is then up to the administrator who created the team to just add the appropriate users to
each team group. These global groups are still customizable to allow non-standard team setups.
You c on figur e  global team groups and privileges in the hid_global_c on figur ation  table in the Manage
external data store  (DBE) module.
Con figuring  global team groups
To create a team group that will aut omatic ally  be c on figur ed  for team administrators when they create a
new team, add a new entry to the hid_global_c on figur ation  table. Each entry must use the new group
name as the key and each group can have one or more rows.
Each diff er en t  key under the GROUP-PRIVILEGE-ASSIGNMENT setting  will assign a new group to the
default groups for a team. Below is the default group that would be c on figur ed  for the "Team: Create"
request:Con figuring  global privileges
To pre-assign a privilege to a group, assign a value to a default group in the hid_global_c on figur ation
table. Create a new row for each privilege that needs to be assigned to a group. The screenshot below
shows an example of the same group g etting  Auto_Approve and Requester privileges:
