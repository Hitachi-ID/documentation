▪Password replacement program ( pspasswd ) The Bravura Security  password replacement program ▪
(pspasswd) intercepts nativ e  password changes on Unix servers and triggers transparent password
s ynchr oniz ation.
Softw ar e  for Unix triggers is stored on the Bravura Security Fabric  server when you install Connector
Pack . You copy it and c on figur e  it on the LDAP server.
▪OS/400 exit program ( pspwdexit ). This exit program Intercepts password changes on IBM OS/400 ▪
and propagates them to the Bravura Security Fabric server for policy v alidation  and to initia t e
transparent s ynchr oniz ation.
See the Transparent Password S ynchr oniz ation  (on page 1651) for more in f ormation  about this feature
and installing softw ar e  for the above trigger systems.
The OS/390 mainframe trigger software  is shipped with Mainframe Connector. See the Mainframe
Ins t allation  and Configuration  Guide  for more inf ormation.
Domain-level secure kiosk account softw ar e
A domain-level secure kiosk account is a specially constructed and locked-down network oper ating
system login account. It is typically used to allow users who forgot or otherwise disabled their network
login password to gain access to a self-service password reset facility.
The <Program Files path>\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\<instance>
\addon\Domain SKA\ directory contains tools that are installed on a public share and used with the
secure kiosk account (SKA).
See Login Assistant  (on page 1587) for more in f ormation  about this feature.
Local secure kiosk account softw ar e
This is a local alt ernativ e  to deploying a domain-level secure kiosk account (SKA) with Bravura Security
Fabric . On Windows, it triggers the local equivalent of a Windows GPO (group policy object), and
launches a locally installed shell executable program ( runurl ) and will allow the users to change their
passwords.
You install this softw ar e  on Windows using the ska.msi or ska-x64.msi  (on page 252).
See Login Assistant  (on page 1587) for more general in f ormation  about SKA softw ar e,  and for manual
ins t allation  ins tructions.
Bravura Security Fabric  local reset extension
The Activ eX  add-on, pslocalr.ocx , can silently update the user’s Windows password cache after  a
web-based password change via Bravura Security Fabric .
The following local reset extension installers are available:
▪browser-extension-win-x86.msi  for Chrome or Edge Chromium ▪
▪firefox-extension-x86.msi  for Firefox ▪
See Local Reset Extension  (on page 1578) for more general in f ormation  about this feature.Notific ation  client
The Notific ation  Client ( psntfclient ) is required only if users will receive notific ation  via their web
browser. The client is installed on a network share and is responsible for c on t acting  the Notific ation
Service ( psntfsvc ) to determine if users have any pending notific ations.  If they do, the
psntfclient program opens a browser on the user’s w ork s t ation  for the user to fir s t log in and then
to display the notific ation  message in Bravura Security Fabric . If any of those notific ations  are force-level,
the psntfclient opens the browser in kiosk mode, pr e v enting  the user from accessing na vig ation  or
other functionality  until  the user becomes compliant.
You install this softw ar e  using the ntfclient.msi  or ntfclient-x64.msi  (on page 250) installer.
See Batch and web notific ation  (on page 431) for more general in f ormation  about this feature.
Lotus Notes Extension client tools
These tools are used to support Lotus Notes password management. You install this softw ar e  using the
psns.msi  (on page 251) installer.
See Lotus Domino Server  in the Connector Pack  documen t ation  for more in f ormation  about t ar g eting
Lotus Notes.
Local w ork s t ation  service
Bravura Security Fabric  uses the Bravura Privilege  Local W ork s t ation  Service ( hipamlws ) softw ar e  (on
page 245) to perform local password resets and other oper ations  for local service mode .
See Managed systems  (on page 1815) for more in f ormation  about how to install and use this feature.
Access disclosure plugins
Bravura Security Fabric  uses access disclosure plugins to permit secure access to a password for a
privileged account. Unlike scripted or executable plugins, these are JavaScript or web-based controls.
See Access disclosure plugins  (on page 1957) to learn how to c on figur e  these controls.
Installing ActiveX  controls is no longer a supported method. Use an alt ernative  disclosure plugin such as
Guacamole  (on page 1975), as Internet Explorer is no longer a supported browser. For inf ormation  about
ActiveX  controls see documen t ation  for Bravura Security Fabric  12.5  or older.
Using MSI installers
This section  provides general in f ormation  about using MSI installers to install Bravura Security  add-on
softw ar e:
▪Manually  (on page 243) ▪
▪ Aut omatic ally ,  using a group policy  (on page 243). ▪Requirements
In order to create required accounts and install softw ar e  on Windows w ork s t ations,  you must launch the
MSI installer using elevated privileges. The client w ork s t ation  must have Windows Server 2008/Windows
7 or later installed.
Support for earlier operating  systems is available upon request. Contact support@bravurasecurity.com
for additional  assistance.
To enable the MSI installer to run with elevated privileges, create a local computer policy with the
following privileges enabled:
▪Computer Con figur ation  > Adminis tr ativ e  Templates > Windows Components > Windows Installer > ▪
Always install with elevated privileges
▪User Con figur ation  > Adminis tr ativ e  Templates > Windows Components > Windows Installer > ▪
Always install with elevated privileges
If you want the installer package to install aut omatic ally ,  with no end-user in t er action,  you must set
ins t allation  options  by applying a Windows Installer Transform file (.mst ), or by editing  the installer
package directly. If you are not sure how to do this, contact support@bravurasecurity.com .
Manual ins t allation
To manually install add-on softw ar e,  you can launch the appropriate MSI installer either by double-
clicking the file or by using the Windows msiexec.exe  command-line utility .  You then proceed
through a series of graphical user interface (GUI) pages to specify options  for ins t allation.  An easier way
to record installer choices that you provide in the GUI, and even some settings  not available in the GUI, is
to run the MSI from the command line, with the options  described in Add-on ins t allation  command-line
options  (on page 245). See your Windows help for more in f ormation  about Windows Installer
technologies.
Customizing an MSI
You can customize an add-on msiinstaller by modifying it with an MSI editor such as Orca. Orca is a table
editing  tool that can be used to edit .msi files.  In f ormation  on how to use Orca and where to download it
can be found at http s://docs.micr osoft.c om/ en-us/window s/desk t op/msi/ or c a-e x e . Pr operties  can also
be specified  on the command-line or in a Windows Installer Transform file.
Aut omatic  ins t allation  using a group policy
With a Windows group policy, you can easily deploy a Bravura Security  msi to a group of users or
computers. If you set options  for ins t allation,  such as the URL to the Bravura Security Fabric  server,
before deploying the softw ar e,  no end-user input is required.
Contact your Windows system administrator or Windows documen t ation  for more inf ormation  about
using Windows Installer technologies.
For in f ormation  about installer command-line options,  visit:http://msdn.micr osoft.c om/libr ar y/de f ault.asp?url=/libr ar y/ en-us/msi/ se tup/ c ommand_line_options.asp
The following steps outline the general procedure for c on figuring  a group policy to deploy an installer
package to computers in a domain (see your Windows help for more in f ormation).  You must perform
these steps using administrator privileges:

Upgrading Local W ork s t ation  Service softw ar e
Con figur ation  files
When the Local W ork s t ation  Service is installed on the system, it fir s t attemp ts  to register with the
Bravura Privilege  server. After  it has contacted the Bravura Privilege  server for the fir s t time,  it retrieves
c on figur ation  settings  from the Bravura Privilege  server. The service saves the settings  in a c on figur ation
file, hipamlwsinst.dat , in the <Program Files path\>Bravura Security\hipamlws\
directory.
The hipamlwsinst.dat  file contains settings  such as poll time  (pt), r es ynchr oniz ation  interval (ri),
r es ynchr oniz ation  failure retry interval (rfri), tr ansaction  failure retry interval (trfi),  and the calculated
machine ID (id). The file also records tasks, assigned by the Bravura Privilege  server when contacted by
the local service, that need to be done on the managed system. The service reports the results of the
tasks at the next poll of the server.
The wait time  is de fined  by the initial  delay value setup during the ins t allation  of the Local W ork s t ation
Service (or the registry key initial-poll-dela y).  After  it fir s t registers with the Bravura Privilege  server as a
discovered system, it will c ontinue  to contact it at the poll time,  de fined  by the pt value in the
hipamlwsinst.dat  c on figur ation  file. The default is 300 seconds. Once the system is managed, it
adopts the poll time  de fined  on the Bravura Privilege  server’s RES POLL INTERVAL setting  (Manage the
system > Privileged access > Options  >  General > Managed system policies ). The default is 60 minutes.These files should not be modified  as they may send incorrect data back to the Bravura Privilege server or
cause the Local W ork s t ation  Service to behave improperly.
Data files
The Local W ork s t ation  Service keeps tracks of all attribut es  and discovered accounts found locally on the
system in data files in the <Program Files path\>Bravura Security\hipamlws\ directory. These files are
used to determine what data should be sent back to the Bravura Privilege  server when changes occur.
The following data files can be created:
▪hipamlwsmachine keeps track of the system attribut es,  including local w ork s t ation  mode system’s ▪
name, address, IP settings,  and custom attribut es
▪hipamlwsusr keeps track of the user accounts discovered on the system ▪
▪hipamlwsgrp keeps track of groups and group memberships discovered on the sysem ▪
The service detects changes to local system settings,  and updates the data files and updates settings  on
the Bravura Privilege  server, at poll time.  These changes can trigger import rule e v aluations,  depending
on the import rules setup and which attribut es  are used.
These c onfiguration  files can only be accessed after  the local system administrator takes ownership of the
files and grants users access to them.
These files should not be modified  as they may send incorrect data back to the Bravura Privilege server or
cause the Local W ork s t ation  Service to behave improperly.
