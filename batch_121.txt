r esulting  .png file is copied into the <instance>\reports\spool directory.
Report to pr e-de fined  request c ancellation  plugin
You can specify a plugin to allow the c ancellation  of requests generated from reports. This is useful, for
example, where a request to resolve a rule c on flict  has been marked as "acceptable" in the past. In this
case, the plugin would return an ins truction  to Bravura Security Fabric  to not submit the request.
To c on figur e  this plugin, type the plugin’s full name in the REPORT TO PDR REQUEST CANCELLATION
PLUGIN field  on the Manage the system > Modules> Manage reports (RPT) page.

F eder ation  / Web Single Sign-On
The F eder ation  / Web Single Sign-on  module provides c on figur ation  options  for the deployment of the
Scenario.hid_saml_idp  component. See Authentic ation  chains: SAML  (on page 923) for details.Groups app
Applies to Bravura Identity  
 and Bravura Privilege 
The Groups app allows users to request changes to group membership, or to create or update groups if
they have assigned privileges.
Access to Groups app options  is controlled by giving users access to applicable pr e-de fined  requests, as
described below.
Group members
All end users can view their group membership and request changes to group memberships via the
Groups  app. You can c on figur e  the Groups  app so that users see r ec ommendations  of group memberships
(on page 1207) to add or delete, based on consistency among peers.
Group ownersGroup owners can use the Groups  app update groups when they have access to the following pr e-de fined
requests:
P r e-defined  request Description
_GROUP_ADD_MEMBERS_ Add accounts and child groups as members to multiple
groups on target systems.
_GROUP_ADD_OWNERS_ Add owners to multiple  groups on target systems.
_GROUP_ADD_PARENTGROUPS_ Add parent groups to multiple  groups on target systems.
_GROUP_DELETE_ Delete a group on a target system.
_GROUP_DELETE_MEMBERS Delete members from multiple  groups.
_GROUP_DELETE_OWNERS Delete owners from multiple  groups.
_GROUP_DELETE_PARENTGROUPS Delete parent groups from a multiple  groups.
_GROUP_UPDATE_ATTRS Update attribut es  on one or more groups.
Product administrators must also c on figur e  group attribut es
in the Resource attribut es  menu, as described in the
example below  (on page 1209).
_GROUP_UPDATE_MEMBERS Add or remove members from a group.
_GROUP_UPDATE_OWNERS Add or remove owners from a group.
_GROUP_UPDATE_PARENTGROUPS Add or remove parent groups from a group.Group creators
Members of the _GROUP_CREATE_USERS_ user class  (on page 733) can use the _GROUP_CREATE pr e-
de fined  request  (on page 1311) to create a group on a target system.
Group report readers
Users who belong to a user class set in system variable GROUPAPP REPORT ACCESS  (on page 1199) can
view and run reports via the Groups app.
In addition,  the Python sample script vie w_gr oup_filt er_and_click able_link.p y  must be copied to
<instance>/plugin and set in the system variable VIEW GROUPS PLUGIN  (on page 1203).
See also
When Bravura Identity  is licensed, self-service users can also request changes to group membership via
the View and update pr ofile  (on page 1178) menu.
The examples below use settings  and users from a demons tr ation  environment. See end-user
documen t ation  for more generic procedures for view and managing groups .Enabling group membership r ec ommendations
You can c on figur e  the Groups  app and group request pages so that users see r ec ommendations  of group
memberships to add or delete, based on consistency among peers.
A peer group is a group of users with some attribut e  in common; for example, users working at the same
loc ation  or department, or having the same manager.
When enabled, group membership r ec ommendations  are displayed in the Groups  app and the Change
group membership page in request wizards. R ec ommendations  are visually represented by a color bar
with a number s t ating  the percentage of peers who are members. This can help the user to decide
whether to add or delete membership. The r ec ommendations  color bar is:
1.Red, where membership is not recommended; that is, most of a user’s peers are not members. 1.
This is indicated where the number of users with the membership is between 0% and a lower
threshold.
2.Yellow, where membership is recommended: that is, some of the user’s peers are members.2.
This is indicated where the number of users with the membership is between a lower threshold and
an upper threshold.
3.Green, where membership is strongly recommended; that is, most of a user’s peers are members.3.
This is indicated where the number of users with the membership is between an upper threshold and
100%.
The following screenshot shows how r ec ommendations  are displayed in the request wizard:
The display of r ec ommendations  is controlled by the following system variables in the Manage the
system  > Modules  > Options  menu:GROUP APP MATCHING ATTRIBUTE GROUP The attribut e  group used to de fine  a peer group. If set,
the Groups app includes a R ec ommendation  button
that toggles the display of r ec ommendations.
GROUP APP MATCHING USERS LOWER THRESHOLD 0-100 value r epr esenting  the recommended values
(yellow threshold).
GROUP APP MATCHING USERS UPPER THRESHOLD 0-100 value r epr esenting  the highly recommended
values (green threshold).
SEARCH FILTER RECOMMENDATION CUTOFF If the search filt er  plugin returns a ”showOnly” value of
1, this sets the default 0-100 lower threshold to filt er
on. Values less than this cut off  will be filt er ed  out by
the plugin.
Example: Group membership r ec ommendations
This example illustrates how to set up the entitlemen t  consistency r ec ommendations  when certif ying
group memberships. The peer group is users that have the same manager, calculated based on the
ORGCHART_MANAGER attribut e,  which is a member of the CERT_ORGCHART_MANAGER group.
Configur e  global settings  
To c on figur e  global settings  for the r ec ommendation  engine:
1.Click Manage the system  > Modules  > Options . 1.
2.Set the following:2.
GROUP APP MATCHING ATTRIBUTE GROUP CERT_ORGCHART_MANAGER
GROUP APP MATCHING USERS LOWER THRESHOLD 20
GROUP APP MATCHING USERS UPPER THRESHOLD 50
3.Click Update 3.
View group membership r ec ommendations  
To view group membership r ec ommendations:
1.Log into Bravura Security Fabric  as an end user. 1.2.From the main menu, click Groups . 2.
3.Click the All filt er  in the Filter panel . 3.
4.Click the 
 icon in the top right corner to switch to Table view 4.
5.Click R ec ommendation  in the middle panel. 5.
R ec ommendations  are displayed.
Example: Update group attribut es
Group owners can use the Groups app to update the group description  and other attribut es  c on figur ed
by product administrators.
In this example, we add a resource attribut e  that can be updated by group owners using the standard
_GROUP_UPDATE_ATTRS ( Update attribut es ) pr e-de fined  request. We map the resource attribut e  to an
Activ e  Directory group attribut e,  so that updating  the attribut e  in Bravura Security Fabric  also updates
the group in Activ e  Directory.
Assumptions
This example assumes:
▪Bravura Workforce P attern  is installed. ▪
▪The "AD" Activ e  Directory target system is c on figur ed  as a source of pr ofiles. ▪
▪Group owners in AD are c on figur ed  as group managers in Bravura Identity . ▪
Add a resource attribut e
To add a resource attribut e:
1.Log in to the Front-end (PSF) as superuser . 1.
2.Click Manage the system > Resources > Resource attribut es . 2.
