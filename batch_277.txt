for command-line options  and examples.using either the Manage the system  module or command-line interface.
Note: Changes to group membership can be tracked with the Manage the
system > Resources > Options  > AUTO TRACK MGROUP  option.  If this

De t ecting  changes in AD target system using the "Enable persistent listing"  option
This example shows how to c on figur e  Bravura Security Fabric  to receive changes from Activ e  Directory
and AD LDS LDAP as they happen on the domain controller. This feature is only present on Activ e
Directory DN and LDAP target systems on Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS). It is disabled by
default.
Requirements
This example assumes that:
▪Bravura Security Fabric  and Connector Pack  installed. ▪
▪An Activ e  Directory target system is added as a source of pr ofiles. ▪
Use target system option  to enable persistent listing  in AD target system
1.Log in to the front-end as superuser.1.
2.Click Manage the System > Resources > Target systems  > Manually de fined . 2.
3.Select the Activ e  Directory target system. 3.
4.Ensure that the  Enable persistent listing  box is selected. 4.
5.Click Update to save the change 5.
6.Run auto discovery6.
By default, Bravura Security Fabric  runs auto discovery  every night at 1:30 am. Bravura Security Fabric
aut omatic ally  schedules  (on page 2702) this "psupdate" job when you add your fir s t target system.
To manually start auto discovery , from the Manage the system  (PSA) module, click Manage the system >
Maintenance >  Auto discovery > Execute auto discovery , then click Continue . Bravura Security Fabric
displays the Auto discovery  status page that indicates whether auto discovery  is running. Click Refresh
to update the page.
Each time  it is run, auto discovery  attemp ts  to verify that it is not already running on another server.
Never run psupdate  on more than one replicated Bravura Security Fabric server at the same time.
To run specific  tasks during auto discovery :
1.Clear the All checkbox for Selected target systems . 1.
2.Type, or search for, the IDs of the target systems you want to include.2.
3.Select the tasks you want to include:3.
Task Equivalent commandList data from specified  target
systems.psupdate.exe -target <target ID> -list
Load data from specified  target
systems into the databasepsupdate.exe -target <target ID> -
loaddb
You can also run auto discovery  for specific  targets on the target system in f ormation  page  (on page 489)
or by na vig ating  to Manage the system > Resources > Target systems > <type> , selecting  targets and
clicking Run discovery .
Alt ernativ ely ,  you can start auto discovery  from the command line by running the psupdate  program.
 
See psupdate
The psupdate program initia t es  and controls the auto discovery process. It is responsible for calling
a series of programs and PSLang scripts, which in turn, control e x ecution  of each auto discovery task.
These tasks include:
▪Refreshing proxy servers▪
▪ Listing  in f ormation  from managed systems ▪
▪Evaluate the import rules on discovered systems and accounts and assign them to managed system▪
policies
▪Monitoring list file size ▪
▪ Con figuring  listed computer objects as Bravura Privilege resources ▪
▪ Updating  the Bravura Security Fabric database ▪
▪ De t ecting  out-of-band changes ▪
▪Cleaning up the database▪
▪Checking inventory levels▪
▪Loading user class cache▪
▪ Submitting  aut omatic  assignment requests ▪
▪Synchronize server files and registry keys ▪
▪ Notif ying  the Bravura Security Fabric administrator of errors or warnings ▪
▪ Cr eating  the default scheduled task to run psupdate ▪
You can also run psupdate to update a single user.
Never run psupdate on more than one replicated Bravura Security Fabric server at the same time
In a replic ation  environment, the sending node creates additional  queue files in the <ins t anc e>/db/
replic ation  directory. These are used to store the data to be sent to all replic ation  nodes. Once this
data has been replicated to the nodes, these files are removed.

using either the Manage the system  module or command-line interface, which will run the Persistent
Connector Service ( agtsvc ) on the target.
If you change which objects are listed, where objects are listed from, or which attribut es  are listed; for
example, change the OUs to list users or groups from, complete the following additional  steps:
1.Use targetsync 1.
Use the targetsync  program to synchronize the instance database state with the state from target
systems without blocking other high value r eplic ation  data for prolonged periods of time.
Usage
 targetsync.exe [options]...
Argument Description
-j Specify the number of targets to process in parallel
(default: 1)
-nolist Skip agent list update
-target Specify the ID of the target for which to run targetsync to
synchronize the state of the instance database. This
option  can be used multiple  times  to select multiple
targets
-targetmanual Select all manual targets
-wait Wait for discovery to complete
Examples
1.To synchronize the state of an Activ e  Directory target system AD and a Windows NT target system 1.
WINNT, type:
 targetsync.exe -target AD -target WINNT
2.To synchronize the state of all manual targets, process 2 targets in parallel and wait for discovery to2.
complete, type:
 targetsync.exe -targetmanual -j 2 -wait
to synchronize the instance database state with the state of the target system.
cd C:\Program Files\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\default
\util\ targetsync.exe -target <AD_target_name>
2.Stop discovery on the target system then use the Persistent Connector Service client program.2.

Argument Description
-c --cookie Cookie value to send to connector. This argument is for
developer use only.
-debug Debug logging is enabled for additional  diagnostics.
-full When s t arting  a list, do not c ontinue  the previous list.

-h --help Print out help/usage message and exit
-hid --host <host> Agent service host.
-infolist Shows s t atistic al  in f ormation  in kvgroup format for the
currently running persistent list target.
-i --listid  <ID> ID of the oper ation.
--loopcount Set a limit on list processing for the number of
incremental in t er ations  up to the specified  loop count
after  which persistent list will be terminated. Each
it er ation  is determined by the ’Persistent list search wait
time’  target address option.  If not specified,  the default
is ’0’ to run inde finit ely .
-p --port <port> Agent service port
-showlists Show currently running lists.
