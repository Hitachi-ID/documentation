Since Database Service (iddb) is a long running service, you can manually inform the logging system
that a change was made by running the following command:
idmlogsvc.exe -trace-restart
3.To remove custom logging level settings  for all modules, type: 3.
psdebug -remove
4.To log only error level messages for a script called test with a submodule called test_submodule, type:4.
psdebug -prog test -submodule test_submodule -level 1
5.To log program and stored procedure performance for the T r ansaction  Monitor Service (idtm) service, 5.
type:
psdebug -prog idtm -extlevel perf perf_sproc
6.To log program and stored procedure performance that takes more than 5 seconds for the iddiscover6.
program, type:
psdebug.exe -prog iddiscover -level 4 -maxwait 5
Capturing log data on other systems
You can use the logutil  program to manually capture log data. The logutil  program logs the data
to a specified  log file. This can be used to troubleshoot issues on target systems where client or server
tools have been installed.
The logutil program could be used for t esting  purposes on the Bravura Security Fabric  server instead
of the Logging Service. In this scenario, you would turn off the Logging Service and turn on logutil
prior to e x ecuting  specific  actions  to capture the log output for those actions.
Do not run logutil and Logging Service at the same time  on the same server – they could interfere
with each other.
If you terminate logutil by using [Ctrl] -[C], [Ctrl] -[Break] or by closing the window, then the logging
session is also terminated.
In addition  to being available on the Bravura Security Fabric  server, logutil can be copied to other
servers to test client tools or the Password Change Notific ation  Module. The 64-bit logutil program
is located in the util directory, and the 32-bit version is located in <instance> \ util\x86\. The program is
installed with Bravura Privilege  client softw ar e  in:
<Program Files path\>Bravura Security\hipamlws\util\
The Logging Service is not required on client w ork s t ations.
See logutil
Requirements
You must run the logutil  command as an administrator with sufficien t  privileges.
Usage
logutil.e x e  [options]  -instance <instance> | -cleanup [-instance <instance> ]Argument Description
-bufmax <count> Maximum number of buff er s.  The default value is the
Windows Events MinimumBuff er s  + 20.
-bufmin <count> Minimum number of buff er s.  The default value is the
number of CPUs + 2.
-bufsize <size> Size of the session buff er s  in multiples  of 4 kb. The
default is 64 kb.
-instance <instance> Instance to watch events for. For Bravura Privilege local
service mode instances, the value is "Privileged Access
Manager Client".
-cleanup Terminate any logging sessions which are not connected
to any activ e  client. If the instance name is specified,  only
the logging session for this particular  instance is cleaned
up.
-level <level> Debug level 1-5. Default is 5.
-list List all enabled Event Tracing for Windows sessions.
-logfile  <filename> File to write events to. You must specify an absolute path.
-makekey Generate an instance name and its log GUID in the
registry.
Note:  This option  needs to be run once only.
-maxdelay <maxdelay> The maximum seconds to allow the sorting  buff er  to keep
items before flushing  out into the log file. The default
value is 300.
-maxsorted <count> The maximum number of events that can be sorted in
memory. The default value is 100,000.
-outdbg Write events with an output debug string.
When logutil  runs, a new registry entry is created to record the session. The entry is stored under:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\<instance>\LogSession
The name of the entry is the instance name. When you press [enter]  to stop a session, the key will be
gone with the session; however, if you kill the session by typing [Ctrl] +[C], the registry entry will remain.
Use the -cleanup option  to remove remaining registry entries.
Note that various tools also have hardcoded instance names:

Gener ating  a c on figur ation  summary
At the c ompletion  of auto discovery  Bravura Security Fabric  can write a summary of c on figur ation  settings
for an instance. The summary is written  to a file called config- <yyyy >-<mm>-<dd>.kvg in the Logs
directory. The file can be used by Bravura Security  support to help provide assistance.
You can control this function  using the Maintenance > Options  > PSUPDATE INSTDUMP setting.  When
enabled (disabled by default), psupdate runs the instdump program. See instdump
The instdump program is run at the end of the auto discovery process and writes a c on figur ation
summary to a file named c on fig-<y y y y>-<mm>-<dd>.kv g  in the Logs directory. The file can be used by
Bravura Security support to help provide assistance.
The psupdate program runs the instdump program when the Maintenance > Options  > PSUPDATE
INSTDUMP  setting  is enabled (disabled by default).
Some arguments are dependent on the Bravura Security product license.Usage
instdump.exe [ <options> ] -outfile <outfile>

Health check
Bravura Security Fabric  servers can only be reliable if the environment they operate in is reliable. The
Health check monitor reports on issues that may hinder performance.
Health check monitor is installed and enabled when Bravura Security Fabric  is installed and will
periodically report the status of the following components:
▪Admin events▪
The Functional.hid_healthcheck_admin_events  component scans the Windows event
logs for critic al  failures related to r eplic ation  queue or the loaddb stored procedure.▪ Applic ation  crashes ▪
The Functional.hid_healthcheck_app_crashes  component scans the Windows event
logs for applic ation  crashes that have occurred within a specified  amount of days.
▪Disk space - Drive C▪
The Functional.hid_healthcheck_disk_space  component provides an alert when the
c on figur ed  disk drive free space drops under the c on figur ed  thresholds. Bravura Security Fabric
administrators can customize this component, including adding additional  drives to monitor, and the
alert thresholds.
▪Health Check password c on flict  count ▪
The Functional.hid_healthcheck_pwd_conflict_count  should be enabled for Bravura
Privilege and runs pwdconflicts  to identif y  e xisting  password c on flicts.
▪Long processes▪
The Functional.hid_healthcheck_long_processes  component checks for, and flags
processes running under the Bravura Security Fabric  instance directory on the server that run for
longer than the c on figur ed  threshold. This can be used, for example, to check for "stuck" listing  agents
c on figur ed  with "in finit e  timeout"  which would prevent Autodiscovery from proceeding and alert an
administrator.
▪Services▪
The Functional.hid_services  component ensures that Bravura Security Fabric  services are
running if they are set to aut omatic ally  run. If the component finds  that the service is not running it
will report a critic al  issue.
▪URL▪
The Functional.hid_healthcheck_url  component attemp ts  to connect to the c on figur ed
url, to check if the WebUI or some other monitored applic ation  endpoint is available.
By default, Health check monitor provides generic functionality .  To obtain the most from this feature, it is
recommended that the various components be c on figur ed  to suit your particular  environment. At a
minimum the following updates are recommended:
▪Add email addresses to receive email notific ations ▪
▪Add additional  drives to be monitored and set the alert thresholds to suit your environment. ▪
▪Add URLS to be monitored▪
See the Health check monitor c on figur ation  example  (on page 2797) for a walkthrough of the common
cus t omiz ations  recommended.
If none of the healthcheck tasks are needed, the product administrator can disable the Windows
Scheduler > Library > HID Healthcheck  task and either disable the healthcheck components or uninstall
them. See Components  (on page 312) for more in f ormation  on how to do this.
DashboardThe status of the health check components are displayed on a dashboard in the Front-end  module. You
can view the details by expanding each individual component.
The Health check monitor is driven through Windows Task Scheduler. The task is set to run every fiv e
minutes by default. Use the Windows Task Scheduler to modify the interval to suit your needs.
Each test is denoted by one of two statuses:
▪OK - the component is working normally. ▪
▪ Critic al  - an outstanding issue requires immediate attention. ▪
Health check monitor c on figur ation  example
This example demonstrates how to edit the hid_healthcheck_con figur ation  table to make the following
changes:
▪Add product administrator email addresses▪
▪Add additional  drives and c on figur e  threshold values to be monitored ▪
▪Add a second url to monitor▪
▪Edit the processes monitored▪
1.From the main menu, click Manage external data store . 1.
2.Click hid_healthcheck_c on figur ation . 2.
3.Search for Namespace "HEALTHCHECK_DISK_SPACE".3.
4.Edit the row for the EMAILS setting  and add the email address of the product administrator. 4.
5.Add the following new set of entries in order to have health check monitor other disk partitions. 5.
Ensure the Key value is diff er en t  from the e xisting  entries.
Namespace Setting Key Value Description
HEALTHCHECK_DISK_SPACE DESCRIPTION 2 Disk space - Drive D The description
HEALTHCHECK_DISK_SPACE EMAILS 2 alerts@example.com Comma separated list of
emails
HEALTHCHECK_DISK_SPACE EMAIL_THRESHOLD 2 info Threshold to send emailsNamespace Setting Key Value Description
HEALTHCHECK_DISK_SPACE EMAIL_SEND_DELAY 2 60 Delay between emails in
minutes
HEALTHCHECK_DISK_SPACE DEVICE_ID 2 D: Device ID for drive
HEALTHCHECK_DISK_SPACE MIN_SIZE 2 30 Critic al  threshold for disk
size in GB
HEALTHCHECK_DISK_SPACE MIN_FREE 2 5 Critic al  threshold for free
disk space in GB
HEALTHCHECK_DISK_SPACE MIN_PERCENT_FREE 2 10 Critic al  threshold for
percent free disk space
The DEVICE_ID value on the e xisting  entry can be edited from C: to another drive if you do not want to
monitor C:.
Ensure the MIN_SIZE, MIN_FREE and MIN_PERCENT_FREE values are slightly smaller than the values
from the service\iddb.cfg  c onfiguration  file, so that the warning email about running out of
space goes out before the Database Service actually runs out of space.

Backups and restores
Ensure that your back-end database system is adequately set up to handle backup and recovery
oper ations.  Consult the documen t ation  provided with your database softw ar e  to learn how to do this.You should also back up any custom files (user interface, PSLang scripts, binaries) so your cus t omiz ations
can be restored in the event of a system failure.
After  restoring a database ensure the service broker is enabled. To enable service broker execute the
following query:
ALTER DATABASE <database name> SET ENABLE_BROKER WITH ROLLBACK
IMMEDIATE 4 Database Maintenance
The Bravura Security Fabric  database and database server require ongoing maintenance to prevent poor
performance, system do wntime  and data loss. The following guidelines will help reduce the risks:
▪It is recommended to monitor the database server disk space, using Bravura Security Fabric ’s health ▪
check  (on page 2795) feature or an alt ernativ e.
▪Monitor RAM availability and in v estig a t e  any services that maybe leaking RAM. ▪
▪Database maintenance tasks; for example, de fr agmen t ation  and index rebuilding should not be ▪
scheduled at the same time  as psupdate and other instance processes which update a lot of
records in many tables. If the tasks and processes run at that same time  they will lock each other’s
processes, r esulting  in the instance process, database maintenance, or both, to hang.
▪When performing long-lasting  database maintenance; for example, index rebuilding, OS or database ▪
patching that is expected to take more than 10-20 minutes it is recommended to stop updating  the
database.
▪If the database maintenance activity  requires a database upgrade, ensure that the upgrade version is ▪
c ompatible  with Bravura Security Fabric  (on page 172).
▪In a replicated environment, Bravura Security Fabric  requires that all nodes in the instance run the ▪
same database version. If the database is to be upgraded, instance do wntime  is required and
database maintenance on all nodes should be scheduled.
▪Do not schedule database maintenance at the same time  on all databases which serve the same ▪
applic ation.
▪Before the database maintenance starts:▪
▪Ensure no bulk processes are running on the applic ation  nodes that update that specific  database. ▪
▪Remove the applic ation  node(s) using that database from the load balancer. ▪
▪Wait for outgoing iddb queues to subside. ▪
▪Stop the iddb service. ▪
▪ After  the database maintenance is completed restore the applic ation  function  in reverse order. ▪
Monitor idmsuite.log  when the product services (especially iddb)  are s t arting  up, and address
any errors before c ontinuing.
If the cgi\nodestat.exe (or its use as a REST endpoint) is used for load balancers to determine
node availability, stopping iddb  is enough to stop incoming requests from the load balancer to that
node.
For additional  in f ormation  on SQL database maintenance, see Micr osoft’ s  best pr actice  maintenance
r ec ommendations.
5 Oper ating  system patch management
This section  provides guidance on the key things to consider when applying Micr osoft  patches to Bravura
Security Fabric  instance servers. Always check the Micr osoft  website for their latest r ec ommendations.
