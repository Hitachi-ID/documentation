This topic covers Windows Server Operating  System patching only and does not cover Bravura Security
Fabric patching. For all Bravura Security Fabric patching see upgrading and migration .
Best pr actices
▪Prepare a company patch strategy that includes:▪
▪A schedule.▪
▪A list of servers to be included and excluded.▪
▪A c ommunic ation  plan to ensure all stakeholders are aware of the upcoming changes to the ▪
environment and any pot ential  outages.
▪ Identif y  servers that cannot be rebooted aut omatic ally  and organize for a manual restart if required. ▪
▪ Micr osoft  typically releases their patches on the second Tuesday of the month. Schedule patching the ▪
development and test environments after  the patches are released to ensure no issues before
proceeding to patch the pr oduction  environment.
▪Perform t esting  after  the patching to ensure Bravura Security Fabric  performs as expected. ▪
▪Consider using a centralized patch management solution. ▪
Do wntime
Do wntime  is a crucial factor when patching. It is recommended that you create a do wntime  plan that is
agreed upon by all stakeholders to reduce the e ff ort  of repeatedly re-organizing each time  you want to
apply patches. Below are a few examples:
▪Follow the standard maintenance window; for example, a r outine  maintenance window for the ▪
development and test environment might be at 11 pm to 4 am on a particular  weekday, and 11 pm to
4 am on the weekend for the pr oduction  environment.
▪A particular  patching window that is only approved to perform patching, and only for a single ▪
deployment environment. For example, a pre-set time  on the second Friday of the month to patch the
development environment, and another time  on the second Saturday for the test environment, and
the third Saturday to patch pr oduction.
When devising your plan also consider:
▪If the pr oduction  environment cannot have a complete outage, group the nodes, with each group ▪
being patched at diff er en t  times.
▪Coordinate each node's database server patching with the node itself; otherwise, you get two outages▪
per node instead of just one. This may include c oor dination  with the OS and database administrators.
Backup
Before applying patches, ensure you have a successful backup in a known state with the non-log services
stopped.
Before applying OS patches
To ensure Bravura Security Fabric  is not adversely a ff ect ed  during the patching process, the following is
recommended before applying oper ating  system patches:1.Turn off auto-discovery. 1.
2.For Bravura Privilege disable r andomiz ation. 2.
3.Disable any windows scheduled tasks that are related to the Bravura instance.3.
4.Disable Bravura Security Fabric  scheduled tasks, including auto-discovery. 4.
5.Stop the Web Server (IIS) or remove the server from the load balance list.5.
6.Shutdown the database service (iddb) service. If the server is in a replicated environment, flush  the 6.
queues fir s t:
a.Stop all Bravura Security  services, except the logging service (logging) and database service (iddb) on a.
all r eplic ation  nodes and allow the r eplic ation  queues to empty.
b.Once all queues are empty, stop the database service on each node.b.
After  applying OS patches
1.Check server logs for any new errors.1.
2.Add the node back to the load balancer if it was removed before patching.2.
3.If the server is a replicated instance, wait until  the queues have decreased or close to empty before 3.
turning the <HID services back on.
4.Enable all OS and Bravura tasks that were disabled for patching.4.
5.For Bravura Privilege, re-enable r andomiz ation. 5.
6.Run tests to ensure Bravura Security Fabric  is oper ating  as expected. 6.6 Performance
After  using Bravura Security Fabric  for several years, the database can grow considerably and can a ff ect
performance and some important functions  of the product.
Many performance improvement tasks require analysis of the data sets and stored procedures. It is highly
recommended to purchase Bravura Security Professional Services.
Best pr actices:
▪Ensure your server meets the minimum requirements:▪
▪ Calculating  the number of servers required ▪
Bravura Security  strongly recommends that you create at least two or three replicated Bravura
Security Fabric  database nodes for fault tolerance and backup, depending on which products are
licensed and which features are implemented. When Bravura Privilege  is installed, or when close to
100% uptime  is required from the instance, the recommended minimum is three. This is because
when backend database r eplic ation  is performed, at least two database nodes have to go down at
the same time.
On the other hand, avoid setting  up too many replicated database nodes. It is likely that the
additional  overhead of any more than six fully replicated nodes would outweigh the advantage of
having multiple  nodes to do work. If you implement transparent password s ynchr oniz ation,  it is
recommended that you avoid having more than fiv e concurrently activ e  database nodes.
Calculate the number of database nodes you require with the following formula:
N = ceil(1 + [ U∕P * 7∕5∕Z * A]∕[60  * 60 * C∕T])
Where:
▪U = # of users▪
▪P = days between password expiry▪
▪Z = time  zones ▪
▪A = accounts/user▪
▪C = # of concurrently running connectors▪
▪T = seconds on average to change a password▪
For example, when:
▪U = 10000 people▪
▪P = 45 days▪
▪Z = 1 time  zone ▪
▪A = 10 accounts/user▪
▪C = 30 connectors at a time ▪
▪T = 2 seconds▪
then:▪N = ceil(1 + [10000∕45 * 7∕5∕1 * 10]∕[60 * 60 * 30∕2]) ▪
▪N = ceil(1 + [3111]∕[54000]) ▪
▪N = ceil(1.0576) ▪
▪N = 2 ▪

▪Server requirements▪
The Bravura Security Fabric  server and any replicated servers must be installed on a Windows
Server oper ating  system. Windows 2016, Windows Server 2019, or Windows Server 2022 is
recommended at the current release level of Bravura Security Fabric .
Installing on Windows Server enables Bravura Security Fabric  to leverage client softw ar e  that is
available only on the "Wintel” platform.  In turn, this makes it possible for Bravura Security Fabric  to
manage passwords and accounts on target systems without installing a server-side agent.
Bravura Security Fabric  stores all of its data in an external database. Micr osoft  SQL Server 2019
(recommended), Micr osoft  SQL Server 2017 , Micr osoft  SQL Server 2016 SP2 , or Micr osoft  SQL Server 2014
SP3 must be installed and c on figur ed  before the Bravura Security Fabric  server softw ar e  can be
installed. See Installing and c on figuring  Micr osoft  SQL Server  (on page 173) for more in f ormation.
Oracle database was supported on versions up to 9.0.x and is not supported on 10.0 or later
releases.
If you are installing the Bravura Security Fabric  on the same server as the database, ensure you
take into c onsider ation  the server requirements for the database softw ar e  when c alculating  the
requirements for the Bravura Security Fabric  server.
Each Bravura Security Fabric  applic ation  server must also be c on figur ed  with a web server. The
Bravura Security Fabric  installer is aware of and can aut omatic ally  c on figur e  IIS web servers for use
with Bravura Security Fabric .
The Bravura Security Fabric  server is a security server, and should be locked down accordingly. See
Locking down a Bravura Security Fabric  server  (on page 302) for details. In short, most of the nativ e
Windows services can and should be removed, leaving a very small attack  surface, with exactly one
inbound TCP/IP port (443):
▪No ASP , JSP or PHP are used, so such code interpreters should be disabled.▪
▪Web-facing .NET is not used and should be disabled (some connectors require it, due to .NET▪
API bindings).
▪No ODBC or DCOM are required inbound, so these services should be filt er ed  or disabled at the ▪
web server. As with .NET, ODBC is sometimes  needed to connect to target systems.
▪Inbound file sharing should be disabled. ▪
▪Remote registry services should be disabled.▪▪Inbound TCP/IP c onnections  should be fir e w alled,  allowing only port 443, remote desktop ▪
services (to c on figur e  the softw ar e)  and a handful of ports between Bravura Security Fabric
servers, mainly for data r eplic ation.
Each Bravura Security Fabric  server requires a database instance. Micr osoft  SQL Server 2019 is the
recommended choice. Micr osoft  SQL Server 2017, 2016 SP2 and 2014 SP3 are also supported.
Oracle database was supported on versions up to 9.0.x and is not supported on 10.0 or later
releases.
Bravura Security Fabric  is c ompatible  with 64-bit Windows Servers:
▪The core softw ar e  is compiled as 64-bit binaries. ▪
▪Programs that execute in the context of the core oper ating  system, such as password ▪
s ynchr oniz ation  triggers, event hooks, etc. are available in both 64- and 32-bit versions for
c ompatibility .
▪Primary server requirements▪
Each Bravura Security Fabric  server is c on figur ed  as follows:
▪Hardware requirements:▪
▪Intel Xeon or similar CPU. Multi-c or e  CPUs are supported and leveraged. Dual core is a ▪
minimum.
▪At least 16GB RAM – 32GB or more is leveraged and is typical for a server.▪
▪At least 600GB of HD storage, preferably in an enterprise RAID c on figur ation  for reliability ▪
and preferably larger for r e t ention  of more historical and log data.
More space is always better ,  to increase log r e t ention.
▪At least one Gigabit Ethernet NIC.▪
Ensure you take into c onsider ation  the hardware requirements of any other softw ar e  that
may share the Bravura Security Fabric  server; for example, database storage requirements.
See Support for virtual machines  for more in f ormation  about support for virtual machines.
▪ Oper ating  system: ▪
▪Windows Server 2022.▪
▪Windows Server 2019.▪
▪Windows Server 2016.▪
It is recommended that the server is not a domain controller.
▪Networking:▪
▪TCP/IP networking, with a s t atic  IP address and DNS name entry ▪
▪Cryptographic certific a t e ▪
▪ Micr osoft  .NET Framework 3.5 and 4.5+ ▪

▪Database / c onnectivity  softw ar e: ▪
▪A Micr osoft  SQL Server 2019  (recommended), Micr osoft  SQL Server 2017 , Micr osoft  SQL Server ▪
2016 SP2 , or Micr osoft  SQL Server 2014 SP3  instance is required to host the Bravura Security
Fabric  schema:
▪Normally one database instance per applic ation  server. ▪
▪The SQL Server database softw ar e  can be deployed on the same server as the Bravura ▪
Security Fabric  applic ation,  as this reduces hardware cost and allows applic ation
administrators full DBA access for tr oubleshooting  and performance tuning purposes.
See Where to install the softw ar e  for more in f ormation.
▪If the database softw ar e  is deployed on a separate server, it is recommended that you install ▪
the client softw ar e  (on page 172) that corresponds to the database backend.
See Installing Database and Database Client Softw ar e  (on page 172) for details.
▪Connector Pack : ▪
▪The Connector Pack  contains connectors which integrate Bravura Security Fabric  with target ▪
systems.
▪It is recommended, but not required, that you install the Connector Pack  after  the Bravura ▪
Security Fabric . This allows you to select ins t ance-specific  or global ins t allation.
See the Connector Pack Documen t ation  for details.
▪Installed and tested softw ar e: ▪
▪ Nativ e  clients for the systems that Bravura Security Fabric  will interface with. Refer to the ▪
Connector Pack Documen t ation  for in f ormation  specific  to each type of target system.
▪Python 3.11.2+▪
Python 3.11.2+ must be installed before installing Bravura Security Fabric. It is required for
certain Bravura Security Fabric components, including the Python IDMLib library used to help
create plugin programs, Health check monitor , and reference builds.
Ensure that Python is installed for all users to allow the Bravura Security Fabric service user
(psadmin) account to have appropriate access to the Python ins t allation.
It is recommended to add Python to the system PATH. This may also be added by selecting
the option  for ” Add Python 3.11 to PATH” during the Python ins t allation.
Python 3.11.2+ is optional  for Connector Pack ins t allations.  It is however required for the
agtpython  and pxpython  connectors.
For older versions of Bravura Security Fabric, there are alternate versions of the agtpythonconnector located in the agent\alt directory and alternate versions of the pxpython
connector located in the interface\alt directory that are c ompatible  with specific  versions.
See Installing Python  (on page 200) to learn how to install Python to meet these
requirements.

▪ Micr osoft  Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable (x64 and x86) ▪
Micr osoft  Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Package is required for Bravura Security Fabric
10.0 and higher. It is required for certain Bravura Security Fabric  run-time  components that
use Visual C++ libraries. This is aut omatic ally  installed during setup , if prerequisites are
met.
The installer checks prerequisites for C++ runtime  and universal CRT. Before these two can be
installed, the system requires the KB2919355 update (this is a set of patches, which has to be
installed in order by clearc ompressionflag.e x e,  KB2932046, KB2959977, KB2937592,
KB2938439, KB2934018). KB2938439 must be patched before KB2919355 can be patched.
During the ins t allation  of patches, if a Windows dialog box displays the message: ”Theupdate is not applicable to your computer” and you are sure that you installed the patch that
matches your operating  system, it is likely that there are other prerequisites that need to be
installed before the current patch.
▪At least one web browser (such as Chrome), and PDF viewer (to read the documen t ation) ▪
▪A Git client (for revision control)▪
Anti- virus  software  may impact Bravura Security Fabric functionality  and performance.
Disable WebDAVModule
During the instance pr e-ins t allation  check the installer checks if IIS module "Web Distributed
Authoring and Versioning" (WebDAVModule) is installed. If so, the installer warns that this module
may interfere with REST API usage and that it should be disabled. This can be done after  the
instance is installed.
To disabling WebDAVModule for an already installed instance (named "myinstance" in this
example), run the command:
%SYSTEMROOT%\system32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe delete module /
module.name:"WebDAVModule" /app.name:"Default Web Site/myinstance"
▪Supported database management systems▪
Bravura Security Fabric  works with any of the following database management systems:
▪ Micr osoft  SQL Server 2019 ▪
▪ Micr osoft  SQL Server 2017 ▪
▪ Micr osoft  SQL Server 2016 SP2 ▪
▪ Micr osoft  SQL Server 2014 SP3 ▪
Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of these databases will work.
The Compatibility  level on the Microsoft  SQL Server database must be set to a minimum value of
SQL Server 2014 (120) .
If you are installing SQL Server R eporting  Service (SSRS) to use the Analytics  ensure the server is not
a Domain Controller.
Express editions  should only be used for e v aluation  purposes. Bravura Security  strongly recommends
that, whenever possible, you use an enterprise or standard edition,  rather than the express
database edition.
Database I/O performance on a virtualized file system; for example, VMDK or equivalent, is slow. If
the database server softw ar e  runs on a VM, please use a fast, nearby NAS or SAN to store the
actual data files.
Clustered backend databases can lose data during or after  cluster failover. Bravura Security
recommends using Bravura Security Fabric’s applic ation-le vel  replic ation  rather than clustered
databases whenever possible. If your company policy requires the use of clustered databases, have
database cluster nodes available as close as possible on the network to the Bravura Security Fabricnodes to target directly. See Installing with a shared schema  (on page 229) for setting  up the
Bravura Security Fabric nodes in shared schema.
▪Where to install the softw ar e ▪
Bravura Security Fabric  can be installed on the same server as the database, or on a separate
server.
If Bravura Security Fabric  is installed on physical hardware, deploying the database on the same
server can have the following advantages:
▪Reduce total hardware cost.▪
▪The same performance will be achieved, assuming the database server meets the minimum▪
requirements for the database product.
By default, the Microsoft  database engine will only use one CPU core, due to license res trictions
– the ability to use more CPU cores costs more money.
▪Network latency between Bravura Security Fabric  and the Database Management Server ▪
(DBMS) is reduced to zero.
▪The backup process can be simplified  by taking a snapshot of the complete server, as opposed ▪
to making separate backups of multiple  servers. This makes the restore process much simpler.
▪Both Micr osoft  SQL Server and Bravura Security Fabric  require a Windows server as their host ▪
oper ating  system.
If Bravura Security Fabric  and the DBMS are installed on a virtual machine, ensure the database is
deployed on a disk with high-speed I/0 (not a vmdk file).
Note that two or more Bravura Security Fabric  instance nodes may share database schema. See
Installing with a Shared Schema  (on page 229) for more in f ormation.
▪Recommended database c on figur ation: ▪
▪Recovery mode  - Simple ▪
▪Snapshot Isolation  - On ▪
▪Create s t atistics  - True ▪
▪Update s t atistics  - True ▪
▪Update s t atistics  asynch . - False ▪
▪Store files: ▪
▪On SSDs - only 50% of free space is required for performance e x ecution  without decreasing disk ▪
I/O.
▪On ext file systems - 40% free space is required. An ext3 file system is recommended over ext4 for ▪
not losing data during power failures; zfs is recommended for maximum security, at a minor speed
r eduction  but increase in number of disks required.
If files are stored on a Windows NTFS partition  on a hard disk rather than an SSD, and if there is
less than 2.5x (250%) the size of the files available in c ontiguous  free space, that could lead to
physical file fragmen t ation  and increase disk I/O for the database.▪Set up monitoring on all servers for available physical resources such as RAM, CPU cycles, disk space,▪
and on very busy servers, sockets and handles.
When any of these resources are close to depletion,  especially at their peaks of load, provision more.
▪Do not schedule index rebuilding when large stored procedures like some of the psupdate  ones are ▪
know to run, because it can lock/stall each other, leading to long-running stored procedures.
Schedule index rebuilding after  bulk processes like psupdate are completed.
▪For finit e  resources like sockets and handles, reduce the load on the server by adding more servers in ▪
r eplic ation  and behind load balancers.
▪If the database server waits a long time  for Network I/O and Buff er  I/O, check with the owners of the ▪
hypervisor where the Bravura Security Fabric  database node runs. Tweak those settings  so that virtual
machine gets more priority on those channels.
▪Monitor long-running stored procedures so you can detect ahead of time  when some stored ▪
procedures are taking longer than they normally do; they tend to cause r eplic ation  delays.
▪Navigate to Manage the system > Maintenance> Database r eplic ation  on each node to monitor the ▪
queues.
▪To check what is using up resources in MSSQL, use the server's Activity  Monitor in SSMS, or an ▪
alt ernativ e  solution  your DBA suggests to monitor the server's resources.

Hardware performance
The easiest method to gain performance is to add resources to the database server. Ensure you verify
that the allocated resources are actually usable by the database service; for example, ensure the
hypervisor is not sharing them with other VMs.
▪Free space is very important:▪
▪If there is no space to write changes, both the MSSQL database and our product will stop working.▪
▪The database needs at least 40% free space, because the tempdb  can grow dr amatic ally  during ▪
auto discovery and other bulk upda t es/ aut omation,  the database files tend to get fragmented, and
indexes on very large tables grow fast and can get fragmented as well.
▪Bravura Security Fabric  will stop functioning  when there's more than 90% space used (that's the ▪
Default, but is c on figur able:  can be reduced for very large drives.
▪When the available RAM is exhausted, the Windows OS will proceed to swap to disk, which can make▪
an instance grind to a halt.
