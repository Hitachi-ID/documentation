Part I Notific ationEmail notific ation
Bravura Security Fabric  activ ely  notifies  users about events that may require their attention;  this is
generally done through email. Some Bravura Security Fabric  features, such as authoriz ation  workflo w ,
require the ability to notif y  users and rely heavily on this in t er action.  Some of the events that can trigger
a notific ation  email include:
When this event occurs… Bravura Security Fabric  sends email to…
Product failure The system administrator, so that he or she can
troubleshoot and repair the problem.
Disk space running low The system administrator, so that he or she can r ectif y
before disk space becomes a problem.
A report is generated The help desk user who requested the report.
Access change requested Authorizers, pr ompting  them to take action.
A user’s access rights change The user, indic ating  that changes have been made to his
or her pr ofile  or access.
Access certific ation  begins Reviewers, reminding them to log in and complete their
certific ation  campaigns.
Or g aniz ation  chart c ons truction  begins Managers, asking them to update their lists of
subordinates.
A users' password is about to expire The user, indic ating  it is time  to change their password.
Enrollment is required The user, asking them to enroll in security questions.
Intruder lockout The user, indic ating  there is an intruder lockout on their
account.
One of the early tasks in a Bravura Security Fabric  deployment is to set up an email notific ation  system.
Read this section  to learn about the diff er en t  ways Bravura Security Fabric  determines users’ email
addresses, and how to c on figur e  settings  related to sending email.
Determining users’ email addresses
For a pr oduction  deployment, Bravura Security  recommends that all users have an email address de fined
in Bravura Security Fabric . In most cases, Bravura Security Fabric  determines email addresses by the
value of the EMAIL pr ofile  attribut e,  which can be mapped to an account attribut e  on a given target
system; for example, the EMAIL pr ofile  attribut e  is mapped to the mail attribut e  in an Activ e  Directory
target system by default.
When Bravura Security Fabric  sends messages to users it attemp ts  to determine their email addresses
using:
1.An email override value provided by a requester or by  Bravura Security Fabric  (on page 413) 1.
If no override exists then,
2.The value of the EMAIL pr ofile  and request attribut e  (on page 413) 2.
If no email user attribut e  is set then,3.The plugin de fined  by the IDSYNCH USERS EMAIL PLUGIN plugin point  (on page 414) 3.
If that fails, Bravura Security Fabric  returns an empty string.
The e x ception  is the address of the system administrator, which you set during ins t allation.  You can
modify this address using the RECIPIENT EMAIL field,  which you can modify this setting  on the global
email  (on page 415) page.
Specifying email override values
An email override value can be assigned to a:
▪ St atic  authorizer—This value is provided by a product administrator  when he or she adds the authorizer ▪
to Bravura Security Fabric . Bravura Security Fabric  sends email to the override address whenever the
authorizer’s input is required for any request.
▪Requester—This value is provided by the requester when they make a request. Bravura Security Fabric ▪
sends email to the override address whenever the request is updated.
▪Recipient—This value is provided by a requester when he or she creates an access change request on▪
behalf of the recipient. Bravura Security Fabric  sends email to the override address whenever this
request is updated.
Bravura Security Fabric  sends all other messages to the user’s "regular” email address.
Using the EMAIL pr ofile  and request attribut e
The built-in EMAIL Pr ofile  and request attribut es  is used to gather and store users’ primary email
addresses. There are several ways to populate this attribut e,  including:
▪Loading email attribut es  listed from a target system (recommended) ▪
By default, the EMAIL pr ofile  and request attribut e  is mapped to the account attribut es  listed in the
table below.
▪Allowing users to edit the attribut e  in the View and update pr ofile  (IDR) module. ▪
Before you can do this, you must set up the built-in EMAIL attribut e  and add it to an attribut e  group to
which requesters have read/write access.
Email attribut e  mappings

▪Account attribut es  (on page 553) to learn how to change the default mappings. ▪
▪You can also set up Enforced enrollment  (on page 1183) to direct users to the Password s ynchr oniz ation ▪
r egis tr ation  (PSR) module to fill in their details.
Using the email address plugin (IDSYNCH USERS EMAIL PLUGIN)
The users’ email address plugin receives all in f ormation  about a user, including all attribut es  and
accounts. It can return an email address according to any rule you specify. For example, you may want it
to append the domain name to users’ pr ofile  IDs:
profile ID@example.com
To set the users’ email plugin, type the name of the executable or PSLang script in the IDSYNCH USERS
EMAIL PLUGIN field  on the W orkflo w  > Options  > Plugins page.
There are no shipped plugins for use with the plugin point. See more for in f ormation  on writing  a plugin
Requirements
See W riting  plugins  for general requirements.
Ex ecution  points
When c on figur ed,  the plugin is run by the user notific ation  system and by the W orkflo w  Manager Service,
if installed.
Input
The email address plugin is sent all data about the user whose email address is required.
Input passed to the plugin is as follows:
"" "" = {
"authorizer" = "<profile ID>"
"viewer" "user" = { ...}
# The viewer's data. See ??
}
For example:
# KVGROUP-V1.0"" "" = {
"authorizer" = "marliese.capek"
"viewer" "user" = {
"id" = "marliese.capek"
"name" = "Marliese Capek"
}
}
Output
Output passed from the plugin is as follows:
"" "" = {
"errmsg" = "<error message>" # Error messaged by the plugin
"retval" = "0" # Mandatory; zero is success and non-zero is failure
"authorizer" "<profile ID>" = {
"email" = "<email address>"
# The email address to use for the authorizer
}
}
Following is an example of the output:
"" "" = {
"errmsg" = ""
"retval" = "0"
"authorizer" "marliese.capek" = {
"email" = "marliese.capek@norse.bravurasecurity.com"
}
}
.
Modifying global mail settings
Bravura Security Fabric  sends email using the GLOBAL MAIL PLUGIN plugin. The following plugin
programs, shipped with Bravura Security Fabric , can be used with this plugin point:
▪global-mail-plugin.py  (on page 417), which uses MAIL SEND METHOD to send an email or ▪
writes the email to file. It is enabled by default.
▪plugin-email-domino.exe  (on page 417), which sends mail via a Lotus Notes / Domino mail ▪
system.
To c on figur e  the global mail plugin and other required settings  for sending email:
1.Click Manage the system > W orkflo w  > Email c on figur ation  > Email c on figur ation . 1.When you select the W orkflo w  menu, if the required settings  for sending email are not c onfigured,
Bravura Security Fabric aut omatic ally  directs you to this page.
2.Type values for the options  listed below as required. 2.
3.Click Update . 3.
Option Description
GLOBAL MAIL PLUGIN The plugin to send email.
GLOBAL MAIL PLUGIN
MAILDIRThe directory path to store messages when they are written  to a
file. The  default is <Program Files path>\Bravura
Security\Bravura Security Fabric\Logs
\<instance>\mail .
Ensure that this directory exists.
MAIL AUTH LOGIN The login ID for mailing systems that require authentic ation.
MAIL AUTH PASSWORD The password for the login ID specified  by MAIL AUTH LOGIN.
Note: If you change the MAIL AUTH LOGIN, MAIL SERVER, or
MAIL SERVER PORT value later, you must also update this field.
MAIL CONTENT TYPEEnable to display HTML content in email. When disabled (default)
email content is plain text.
MAIL SEND METHOD The delivery options  for notific ation  messages. This value is used
by global-mail-plugin to send an email and/or write the message
to a file. Valid values are:
 SMTP Send email via MAIL SERVER
 NOTES Send email via a Lotus Notes/Domino mail system
 FILE Write to a file in the directory specified  by GLOBAL MAIL
PLUGIN MAILDIR
Multiple  methods can be used. If the MAIL SERVER is specified,
the default is SMTP; otherwise, the default is FILE.
MAIL SERVER The mail server address.
MAIL SERVER PORT The port number for the SMTP mail server. Default is 25.
RECIPIENT EMAIL A comma-delimited list of email addresses of Bravura Security
Fabric  administrators who should receive notific ation  of events
r elating  to the running of the server.
This value is set during ins t allation.
SENDER EMAIL The email address that will appear as the sender of emails. This is
required if using Lotus Notes or SMTP to send email.
The email server c onfiguration  data is saved in the registry. These settings  are not propagated to
replic ation  nodes unless you run the File R eplic ation  Service  (on page 2862) .  Con figuring  node-specific  settings
The email c on figur ation  settings  are node-specific,  so those system variables are not stored in the
backend database, but in each node's registry.
However, most registry settings  replicate by default  (on page 3581), to ensure that the settings  on
secondary nodes are made from the primary node.
Sometimes  it is useful to add some of these c on figur ation  settings  to the r eplic ation's  utility  blacklist, so
that you can c on figur e  the setting  separately on each applic ation  node.
After  blacklisting  the system variable, you must login separately to each node and change its value
appropriately.
Uses cases
1. Applic ation  administrators usually want to know what node any alerts are coming from, so they can 1.
address the issues on the specific  servers, without having to look at the hidden message headers to
identif y  through which gateways the message moved (sometimes  all emails go through the same
gateway, as in use case 2 below).
Solution:
▪Blacklist SENDER_EMAIL.▪
▪Set its value to something like "instancename-nodename@company.com", for example "prod-▪
pam-001@bravurasecurity.com".
2.Some nodes running in diff er en t  data centers may use diff er en t  SMTP servers, or diff er en t  cr edentials. 2.
Solution:  lacklist MAIL SERVER (and optionally ,  MAIL SERVER PORT).
3.Some nodes in diff er en t  data centers may be managed by diff er en t  teams. 3.
Solution:  Blacklist RECIPIENT EMAIL.
Customizing the global mail plugin
The following plugin programs, shipped with Bravura Security Fabric , can be used with the GLOBAL MAIL
PLUGIN plugin point:
▪global-mail-plugin.py , which uses MAIL SEND METHOD to send an email or writes the email ▪
to file. It is enabled by default.
This plugin should only be changed under supersion from Bravura Security support, as it is a base
product script and any changes will be adding technical debt to be re-added after  any patches are
applied, which will put in place the base version of the script.
