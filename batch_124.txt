We have now c on figur ed  the ENTITLEMENT_EXPIRY_DATE attribut e  so that it can be updated by users. In
the next example, we will c on figur e  the _GROUP_CREATE_ pr e-de fined  request to include the ability to
set an expiry date for each group member.
Example: Create a group
This example shows you how certain users can use the Groups  app to create a group on the Activ e
Directory target system.
Assumptions
This example assumes:
▪Bravura Workforce P attern  is installed. ▪
▪The "AD" Activ e  Directory target system is c on figur ed  as a source of pr ofiles. ▪
▪Group owners in AD are c on figur ed  as group managers in Bravura Identity . ▪
Remove authorizers from the target system
Requests to create groups requires authoriz ation  from the target system authorizers and any group
owners involved in the request. For this demons tration , we are lowering the requirement to just the
group owners by setting  the required authorizers on the Activ e  Directory target to zero:
1.Log in to the Front-end (PSF) as superuser . 1.
2.Click Manage the system > Resources > Target systems > Manually de fined  > AD . 2.
3.Click the Authoriz ation  tab. 3.
4.Change the following entries:4.
▪Minimum number of authorizers  0 ▪
▪Number of denials before a request is terminated  0 ▪
5.Click Update . 5.
Give a user permission to create groups
Users must belong to the built-in user class called _GROUP_CREATE_USERS_ that allows them to access
the Create group  request. For this example, add a single explicit user to the _GROUP_CREATE_USERS_
user class:
1.As superuser, click Manage the system > Policies > User classes . 1.
2.Search for and select the _GROUP_CREATE_USERS_ user class.2.
3.Click the Explicit users  tab. 3.
4.Click Select… . 4.
5.Select the checkbox for an end user; in this example it is ABBIEL.5.6.Click Add. 6.
Add the group entitlemen t  attribut es  to the pr e-defined  request
Now we will add the attribut e  group created in the previous example  (on page 1228) to the
_GROUP_CREATE_ pr e-de fined  request. This will then allow an expiry date to be set for members when
they are added to the group during group cr eation.  You could also add this new attribut e  group to other
pr e-de fined  requests such as _GROUP_UPDATE_MEMBERS.
1.Click Manage the system > W orkflo w  > Pr e-de fined  requests . 1.
2.Search for and select the _GROUP_CREATE_ pr e-de fined  request. 2.
3.Click the Attribut es  tab. 3.
4.Click Select… 4.
5.Select GROUP_ENTITLEMENT_ATTRS.5.
6.Click Select . 6.Configur e  default values for the GROUP_OU attribut e
Adding a default value for the group ou will reduce the chance of human error and ensure the group is
created in the correct loc ation  in Activ e  Directory.
1.On the Attribut es  tab for the _GROUP_CREATE_ pr e-de fined  request, select GROUP_INFO_CREATE. 1.
2.In the OU field,  enter ou=Groups,ou=Demo,dc=<Exampledomain>,dc=corp  as the default 2.
value.
3.Click Update . 3.
