Bravura Pass ’s Generate voice print enrollment PIN  (PSI) module streamlines and increases the security of
the r egis tr ation  process by requiring users to authentic a t e  to receive a longer PIN that is only good for a
single use, and expires after  a de finable  period.
A user registers in the following way:
1.The user logs into Bravura Pass  and navigates to the Generate voice print enrollment PIN page. 1.
2.Bravura Pass  generates a random PIN and displays it to the user. The PIN is good for only one use and 2.

Attach  other accounts (PSL)
The Attach  other accounts  (PSL) module builds on auto discovery , which aut omatic ally  connects standard IDs
to users’ pr ofiles.  Regular users can use the Attach  other accounts  (PSL) module to attach  their own non-
standard login IDs to their pr ofile.
The Attach  other accounts  (PSL) module is enabled by default. To block access to this feature, turn off the
PSL ENABLED setting.  Depending on the user access rules, help desk user s can attach  accounts to users’
pr ofiles,  via the Help users  (IDA) module.
Users cannot attach  accounts on target systems that do not allow password v erific ation.  By default, users
cannot attach  accounts that already belong to another user.
You can modify some defaults for individual targets on the Target system in f ormation  for the target
system.
PSL modes
The Attach  other accounts  (PSL) module can be used in one of two modes:  
Simplified  mode (default): 
1.Users are presented with a list of their accounts. For each account, Bravura Security Fabric  lists the 1.
target system, login ID, whether it is standard, and whether the account is still valid in the column.
2.Depending on the c on figur ation,  users: 2.
▪Enter a login ID, then the corresponding password on the next web page.▪
▪Enter one or more login IDs and password pairs on a single page. The maximum number of pairs▪
allowed is c on figur able.
3.Bravura Security Fabric  searches for all available accounts with the supplied non-standard login ID. If 3.
Bravura Security Fabric  finds  more than one account, users are presented with a list so that they can
choose which account they would like to attach  to their pr ofile.
This step is skipped if Bravura Security Fabric  is c on figur ed  to aut omatic ally  select all returned
accounts.
4.Bravura Security Fabric  v erifies  the user-supplied password on the accounts then attaches  the correct 4.
accounts to users’ pr ofiles.
Advanced mode: 
1.Users are presented with a list of systems where Bravura Security Fabric  can manage login IDs and 1.
accounts.2.Users attach  an account on a system by typing their ID and password beside that system’s description. 2.
3.Bravura Security Fabric  v erifies  that the ID exists and the password is correct. If so, they are attached 3.
to the users’ pr ofiles.
In the Attach  other accounts  (PSL) module’s simplified  mode, users cannot attach  accounts that exist on
a target system that is a source of profile  IDs.

can override this behavior for individual target systems.
PSL DUPLICATE SHOWWhen a user attemp ts  to attach  an account that is already owned by
another user and the oper ation  is not allowed, show the owner of the
account in the r esulting  error message.
PSL MIN ACCOUNTS Require users to attach  <N> accounts in their pr ofiles.  If a value is not
specified,  the default is 1.
If users have not attached  enough accounts, Bravura Security Fabric  can
enforce this requirement by dir ecting  users to the Attach  other accounts
(on page 1183) after  they log in, and displaying an error message.
When you change this setting ,  Bravura Security Fabric  aut omatic ally
schedules the psdonechk program to run once to check compliance. To
modify the scheduled job, click <NavSchedule>, then select PSDONECHK .

must operate in advanced mode.Option Description
PSL SIMPLIFIED MOVE
PASSWORDAllow users to enter <N> login ID and password pairs on the attach  other
accounts page.
If this setting  does not have a value, users type a single login ID on the
attach  other accounts page, then they type a single password on the select
accounts page.
PSL SIMPLIFIED SELECT ALL Aut omatic ally  attach  all accounts that match the supplied login ID and
password pairs to users’ pr ofiles.  When this setting  is enabled, the account
selection  page is not displayed.
PSL SIMPLIFIED MOVE PASSWORD  must also be enabled.
PSL SIMPLIFIED SELECT NONE Do not pre-select any account checkboxes on the account selection  page.
PSL USER VERIFY Verify passwords for e xisting  IDs with a user verify oper ation  rather than
administrator verify oper ation.
PSL VERIFY COUNTS To prevent users from attempting  to attach  accounts that do not belong to
them, the logged-in user is locked out of Bravura Security Fabric  after  a pr e-
de fined  number of password authentic ation  failures . An authentic ation
failure is counted if an ID/password pair fails to match any account.
If you disable this option,  no failure will be counted when an ID/password
pair fails for all attached  accounts, and users will not be locked out of
Bravura Security Fabric .

and is now locked out of Bravura Security Fabric .
User notific ation  (PSN)
The User notific ations  (PSN) module acts as the gateway between the Notific ation  Client ( psntfclient )
and the Notific ation  Service, and enables users to receive, acknowledge, and act on notific ations  from
their web browser
When a web notific ation  is triggered, the user is prompted to log into Bravura Security Fabric  and then
the web browser will open at the Notific ations  page of the User notific ations  (PSN) module. Users can also
access this page, if they have notific ations,  from a link on the main menu.
Enabling / disabling the User notific ations  (PSN) module 
The User notific ations  (PSN) module is enabled by default.
To disable the User notific ations  (PSN) module:
1.Click Manage the system  > Modules  > User notific ation . 1.
2.Turn off PSN ENABLED to disable the module. 2.
3.Click Update to commit your changes. 3.

User notific ations  (PSN) module events that launch interface programs
Option Description
AUP DONE A user accepts an acceptable use policy.
AUP NOT DONE A user declines an acceptable use policy.Modify notific ations  and redirect users
You can use a plugin to modify the order of notific ations  and redirect users as they navigate and act on
notific ations.
When the User notific ations  (PSN) module is enabled and the plugin is set, and a user logs into Bravura
Security Fabric :
1.The plugin presents a list of notific ations  in order of priority. 1.
2. After  the user acts on a notific ation  (clicks Accept or Decline ), the plugin directs the user to the next 2.
notific ation  in the list.
3.When there are no more notific ations  left, the user is directed to the Front-end . 3.
The plugin is set by the PSN MODIFY ORDER AND REDIRECTION PLUGIN field  (Manage the system >
Modules> User notific ations  (PSN) )
There are no shipped plugins for use with this plugin point. See more in f ormation  on writing  a custom
plugin
Requirements
The plugin must return notific ations  not only in order but without any gaps in numbers. If there are 5
notific ations  and you want to show them all, then they will have to be numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. If say they
were numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 then the last one will be hidden.
Notific ations  can be hidden by:
▪ Setting  their priorities  to "0" or any number behind the real sequence; for example if you have 10 ▪
notific ations:  1 through to 10, you can hide notific ations  by setting  the priority to 12, 100 or 9999.
▪Removing particular  KVGroups from output altogether. Ensure that you update priorities  of all ▪
notific ations  "behind" the deleted one.
See W riting  plugins  for general requirements.
Ex ecution  points
This plugin is executed once when a user logs into Bravura Security Fabric .
