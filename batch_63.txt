Bravura Security Fabric  displays a c on firmation  page and asks you whether you want to:
▪Reload all attribut e  values during the next auto discovery – click Yes (recommended). ▪
In this case, Bravura Security Fabric  updates the SQLite-based list files that correspond to the
a ff ect ed  target systems (for example, WINDOWS1.db) with a full attribut e  list.
▪Reload attribut e  values only when the attribut e  changes on the target system – click No. ▪
This may help to speed up auto discovery ; however, it may also result in empty or out-of-date
attribut es  in the Bravura Security Fabric  database.
If the attribut e  was shipped with Bravura Security Fabric  , the overrides for the current level are
removed, and the attribut e  is re-listed under the Defaults tab. If the attribut e  was not shipped with
Bravura Security Fabric  , it is deleted from the system.Template accounts
Bravura Identity  uses template accounts to aut omatic ally  create new accounts based on the parameters
of pr e-e xisting  accounts. In e ff ect,  Bravura Identity  implements a "clone user" oper ation.  Multiple
template accounts can be de fined  for any given target system, r epr esenting  diff er en t  types of users,
uniquely identified  by their group memberships, privileges, home directory loc ations,  and so on.
Template accounts are typically dedicated to this task and do not represent real users.
This chapter shows you how to use the Manage the system  (PSA) module to:
▪Add template accounts▪
▪ Con figur e  template-level authoriz ation ▪
▪ Con figur e  template-level resource oper ations ▪
Getting  started
 Requirements for template accounts 
Before you add templates for account provisioning:
1.Set up model accounts on each target system to use as templates in Bravura Identity . 1.
See the Connector Pack Documen t ation  for in f ormation  about cr eating  accounts on specific  systems.
Ensure that you note the login ID of each model account.
This is not necessary if new account requests will be fulfilled  by human implementers.
It is recommended that you do not add template accounts to managed groups. Managed group
memberships should be handled by including them in roles.
2.Add target systems  (on page 480) to Bravura Identity . 2.
3.Import accounts  (on page 538) from target systems. 3.
Na vig ation  steps
Use the Template in f ormation  page to c on figur e  general template in f ormation  and to access additional
c on figur ation  settings.  To navigate to this page:
1.Click Manage the system > Resources > Template accounts . 1.
2.To de fine: 2.
▪A new template – click Add new… ▪
▪An e xisting  template – search for, or select the template you want to view or modify. ▪
From an e xisting  template’s in f ormation  page, you can click the Authoriz ation  tab to c on figur e
authoriz ation  settings  or the Resource oper ations  tab to c on figur e  overrides and implementers. To return
to the template in f ormation  page, click the General tab.

.
2. Con figur e  the options  from the table below as required. 2.
3.Click Add. 3.
If you are implementing  a role-based access control system, it is recommended that template accounts
are not themselves members of managed groups. This allows you to control group membership by
including the group as a member of a role.
Option Description
ID A unique identifier  for the template.
Description The description  to display to users.
Target system ID Search for, or type the ID of the target system you want.
The model account that you want to clone must exist on this target system.
Account to clone when cr eating  a
new userSearch for, or type the login ID of the account you want to use as a model
or blueprint.
This is required for account provisioning templates. It must be a valid
account listed in the Bravura Identity  database.
Password required Deselect this checkbox if accounts created from this template do not
require a password..
Used as pr ofile  comparison
templateSelect this checkbox if this template is to be used when cr eating  a new user
by copying entitlemen ts  from another user.
Only one template account on each target system can be used for this
purpose. When you add the fir s t template for the target system, this setting
is aut omatic ally  selected. If you set another template as the pr ofile
comparison template on the same target system, the setting  is deselected
from the original template.
Override authoriz ation

De fine  authoriz ation  in f ormation  for templates to:
▪Set the number of approvals or denials required for requests involving the template.▪
▪Assign s t atic  authorizers to de fine  who can approve account requests based on the template. ▪
Users must be loaded into the Bravura Security Fabric database before you can de fine  them as
authorizers.
You must assign enough authorizers to meet the minimum number of authorizers requirement. If you do
not do this, requests involving the resource are aut omatic ally  denied unless authorizers are assigned by a
w orkflo w  plug-in.
Inheriting  authoriz ation  c on figur ation  from the target system
You can c on figur e  target systems so that templates inherit the authoriz ation  c on figur ation  settings  of the
target system. You can also override the c on figur ation  for a template, or add authorizers.
Enable inheritance by selecting  the Default authoriz ation  for child resources,including templates and
managed groups, will be inherited from the target system option  on the relevant Target system
in f ormation  page  (on page 494).

Con figuring  template-level resource oper ations
You can de fine  resource oper ations  for template accounts to:

agents will carry out tasks to fulfill  the requests.
▪Add implementers to a template to de fine  who fulfills  account requests based on the template if an ▪
Bravura Security Fabric  connector is not used.
You can override resource oper ations  at the target system and template level. If the oper ation  is set at
either of those levels to be carried out by an implementer, you must assign at least one implementer. If
you do not do this, requests involving the template will be put on hold unless implementers are
dynamically assigned by a plugin. See Determining implementers  (on page 2402) for details.
Inheriting  resource oper ation  c on figur ation  from the target system
You can c on figur e  target systems so that templates inherit the resource oper ation  c on figur ation  settings
of the target system. You can also override the c on figur ation  for a template, or add implementers.

Assigning s t atic  implementers
When the template-level oper ation  is carried out by an implementer, whether by inheriting  the setting
from the target system, or being explicitly set, an Implementers  table is included on the Implementer
oper ation  page. If implementers are assigned to the target system, they are inherited by the template.
You can remove or keep the inherited implementer, or add new implementers for the template.
If you chose to not inherit the c onfiguration  from the target system, you cannot assign the same
implementer that is assigned at the target system level.
