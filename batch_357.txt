pscp
Use pscp  to copy files.  The pscp  program combines the DOS copy  command with the Unix cp
command.
Usage
 pscp.exe [-r] [-u] <source> [<source> ...] <destination>
 pscp.exe [-r] [-u] <source> [destination]
Argument Description
-r Copy files,  directories and sub-directories recursively.
-u Copy only updated files.  The pscp  program will copy
files if the time  stamp of the source file is later than the
time  stamp of the destination  file, or if the destination
file does not exist.
<source> The source file or directory.
You can use the wild card * for any number of characters,
or ? for a single character.
Note : If you specify multiple  source statements, you must
specify a destination  directory.
If the source is a directory, you must also specify the -r
option.
<destination> Specify the destination  file or directory.
If the destination  directory does not exist, pscp  will
create it as long as only one source statement is
specified.Argument Description
-- Indicate that the following arguments are filenames.  Use
this option  if you are copying a filename  that begins with
"-". Option  is specified  by a double-dash. See example 4.
Examples
1.To copy the file test.log from the current directory to the C:\temp directory, type: 1.
    pscp test.log "C:\temp\test.bak.log"
2.To copy all updated log files from C:\temp subdirectories to the current directory on the C drive, type: 2.

    pscp.exe -ru "C:\temp\*.log" "C:\"
4.To copy the updated file -dash.log to C:\temp, type: 4.
    pscp.exe -u -- -dash.log "C:\temp"psdonechk

The proxydelaycalculator  utility  aut omatic ally  sorts a list of proxy servers by shortest ping time
for a set of target systems.
This is accomplished by sending the proxypinger  utility  to each of the proxy servers and recording
how long it takes each proxy server to ping each target system. The timing  data is then used to create a
sorted list of proxy servers for each target system.
Configur ation
To c on figur e  the proxydelaycalculator :
1. De fine  target systems that need a proxy list assigned. 1.
2. (optional)  If loc ation  attribut es  are used they must be loaded into the instance for each target system. 2.
3.Create a CSV file containing a list of proxy servers 3.
4.Install and c on figur e  the Bravura Security Fabric  proxy service on each of the servers in the CSV list. 4.
This includes a shared c ommunic ation  key for all servers.
5.Run the proxydelaycalculator utility . 5.
Proxy file format
The default format for the proxy file is as follows:
  server,port
  <proxy-server>,<proxy-port>
Where <proxy-server> is either a resolvable host name or the IP address of the proxy server, and <proxy-
port> is the port on which the Bravura Security Fabric  proxy server is listening.
An example file:
  server,proxy
  proxy01.company.com,3344
  proxy02.company.com,3344
  10.0.35.1,3344
If the proxy list is segmented based on a loc ation  code, the CSV file should contain an additional  column
to de fine  each proxy’s loc ation.  A proxy may only have a single loc ation  de fined.  The format for the file
will be:
  server,port,location code
  <proxy-server>,<proxy-port>,<proxy-location>
An example file:
 server,proxy,location code
 proxy01.company.com,3344,MAIN-LAN
 proxy02.company.com,3344,MAIN-LAN

Argument Description
Required arguments:
-port This is the test-port that the proxy servers will try to
"ping" each of the target systems on.
-timeout The maximum amount of time  (in seconds) that the proxy
server should wait for a single ping request to a target
system.
One of the following is required to determine which set of target systems to try to ping:
-all Include all target systems de fined  in the instance.
-hostid Include a single (specified)  target system.
-clear Clears the proxy entries on specified  hosts.
-hos ts file A file containing list of target systems to run against. This
file should be placed in the p sc on fig  directory, and target
systems should be specified  one per line.
Optional  arguments:
-hostgroup Run only against hosts in the specified  host group. Works
with -all or hos ts file.
-source Only include machines discovered from this source target
system. This option  is useful for selecting  machines that
were auto-discovered by a specific  target. Works with -all
or hos ts file.
-platform Specifies  that tests should only be run against targets
with the specified  target type, only works with the -all
option.
-thread Number of threads to be used, default is 10.Argument Description
-sqloutfile Optional  filename  to write (and/or) update the proxy
results to. This will be a SQL/Lite database with the
following columns:
▪hostId▪
▪proxyIp▪
▪port▪
▪LastRunTime▪
▪proxyStatus▪
▪ utilitySt a tus▪
▪overallStatus▪
▪connectTime▪
-enablesim Enables simulated data from the proxies.
-simula t emintime Sets minimum time  returned from simulation,  should
only be used along with the "enable simulation"  option.
-simula t ema xtime Sets maximum time  returned from simulation,  should
only be used along with the "enable simulation"  option.
-simconnfail Sets simulated failure percentage, should only be used
along with the "enable simulation"  option.
-testunassigned Forces agent to only run on targets that do not have a
proxy server set.
-balancetime Load balance time,  if best times  are within this value will
randomly choose one of them.
-pr o xy file Filename which contains the list of proxies to include in
the test. File should be placed in the p sc on fig  directory,
default filename  is proxylist.csv. See above for file format
details and additional  requirements.
-loc ationattr Specifies  a computer attribut e  (from the f oundc ompattr
table) to use as a loc ation  identifier  for proxy filt ering.  If
specified,  the proxy list CSV file must include a loc ation
column (see above for details). If this attribut e  is not
specified,  no loc ation  based filt ering  will be done.
