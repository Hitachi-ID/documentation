Use the following utilities,  shipped with the Password Change Notific ation  Module, to help write the
c on figur ation  file:
user attr s
Use the userattrs program to query account attribut es  in Micr osoft  Activ e  Directory; to find specific
useful attribut es  that may be used as search criteria in designing the intcptsvc c on figur ation  file.
This program is installed by intcpt.msi  or intcpt-64.msi  on a Windows transparent password
s ynchr oniz ation  trigger system and can be found in the following directory:
<Program Files path>\Bravura Security\\Password Filt er\util\
See userattrs usage in f ormation.

verifycfg
Use the verifycfg program to verify that a given account will be bypassed by password strength
checking and/or s ynchr oniz ation,  according to per-target criteria set in the specified  intcptsvc
c on figur ation  file. Neither actual account strength checking, nor s ynchr oniz ation,  is performed by this
utility .  This tool is useful for verifying whether the c on figur ation  file is designed properly before putting
the interceptor online.
This program is installed by intcpt.msi  or intcpt-64.msi  on a Windows transparent password
s ynchr oniz ation  trigger system and can be found in the following directory:
<Program Files path>\Bravura Security\\Password Filt er\util\
See verifycfg usage in f ormation.
 verifycfg.exe  [-c <file>] [-l <level>] -u <user>
Argument Description
-c, --cfg <cfg> Specify the intcptsvc c on figur ation  file. The default is
intcptsvc.cfg
-l, --level <N> The debug level 1-6. The default is 4.
-u, --user The user to be v erified  (required).
Examples
For example:verifycfg.exe -c ..\service\intcptsvc.cfg -u qa1000 -l 4
returns:
Loading service configuration file:[..\service
\intcptsvc.cfg]...succeeded.
Retrieve user:[qa1000]'s attributes and evaluate settings...
User: qa1000
Session has been created successfully
Target: End_Users --
 None bypass      <<== It means this account will be strength checked and synchronized against 'End_Users' target
Retrieve target: [End_Users], user: [qa1000]'s status...( FindUser )
If return code belongs set [( 100 )] will be treated as strength check failed
Target: [End_Users], user: [qa1000]'s status = 200, message = userid=qa1000 username=qa 1000
Returned [200] [userid=qa1000 username=qa 1000], strength check will be successful    <<== The account was found in Pass through idpm.
Target: Admin_Users --
 Bypass both strength check and synchronization <<== It means this account will be NOT strength checked and synchronized against 'Admin_Users' target
If the debug level is greater than 4 (default), verifycfg returns more detail on how the account falls
into which categories.

Usage in f ormation  for the psntfclient program
The Notific ation  Client ( psntfclient ) is required only if users will receive notific ation  via their web
browser. The client is installed on a network share and is responsible for c on t acting  the Notific ation
Service ( psntfsvc ) to determine if users have any pending notific ations.  If they do, the
psntfclient program opens a browser on the user’s w ork s t ation  for the user to fir s t log in and then
to display the notific ation  message in Bravura Security Fabric . If any of those notific ations  are force-level,
the psntfclient opens the browser in kiosk mode, pr e v enting  the user from accessing na vig ation  or
other functionality  until  the user becomes compliant.
Use the ntfclient.msi from the addon directory to install the Notific ation  Client ( psntfclient ).
It is recommended that you install and run the client from a shared folder and include it in a login script.
Requirement
The psntfsvc service  (on page 2835) must be installed and started on the Bravura Security Fabric
server.
The psntfclient program is intended to be run from a public share. The webbrowser.dll , which
is used to open a browser to the User notific ations  (PSN) module if notific ations  exist, must also be
located in the same share.
Bravura Security recommends that the Notific ation  Client communicates with the Bravura Security Fabric
server using SSL (HTTPS).
Ins t allation
The Notific ation  Client can be installed by launching the MSI manually or aut omatic ally  using a group
policy.

Privileged Access Manager Service (idarch)
The Privileged Access Manager Service is installed on each Bravura Privilege  replicated server and is
responsible for:
▪Controlling remote password resets for push-mode managed system policies.▪
▪Monitoring the status of checked out passwords on both push and local service mode managed▪
system policies.
The service is aut omatic ally  installed on the Bravura Security Fabric  server, but not started, during setup.
Note the service ID listed on the Privileged Access Manager Service c on figur ation  page. You use this to
identif y  the service to use when c on figuring  push-mode resources groups.
Configur ation
You can modify the following parameters related to this service on the Service in f ormation  page:
idarch service options
Option Description
Minutes to wait to re-check
databaseThis is the polling period used by the service to check the database for
c on figur ation  changes, and determines when failed password
r andomiz ations  should be retried.
This value is also used to bound the time  interval that the service waits
before it connects to the database after  it is started or restarted. The wait
time  is a random period of time  between 0 and this value.
Avoid setting  a poll time  that would leave a long interval between the password expiry time,  as set by the
RESOURCE PASSWORD CHANGE INTERVAL  (on page 1877), and the poll time.  This could lead to an
expired password not being changed in a timely  fashion.
Command-line options  for idarch are listed below:
idarch service command-line options
Argument Description
-h Displays usage in f ormation.
-v Displays version number only.
-Poll <polltime> Sets the polling period, as described in Table idarch service options.
-SvcID <serviceID> Unique ID used to map managed system policies to the service.
-c on fig Displays service c on figur ation  in f ormation.
-server Run the service in server mode.
-start Starts the service.
-stop Stops the server/serviceGroup set checkin/checkout behavior
This section  outlines the behavior of the Privileged Access Manager Service when a group set check-out/
check-in tr ansaction  between the server and local w ork s t ation  is interrupted.
A group set check-out/check-in tr ansaction  is considered interrupted when the server has given
ins tructions  to the w ork s t ation,  but does not receive a reply. An in t erruption  can be caused by a failed
network c onnection,  for example:
1.The w ork s t ation  polls the server for ins tructions. 1.
2.The server sends group set check-out/check-in ins tructions  and locks the groups that are part of that 2.
set within the database, which are unlocked when a reply from the w ork s t ation  is received.
3.If no reply is received from the w ork s t ation,  the server will consider the set of ins tructions  as lost, and 3.
the groups from the set will remain locked until  the idarch service unlocks them after  fiv e minutes.
The server will also resend the ins tructions  at a later poll (see following steps for more in f ormation).
4.As long as the w ork s t ation  received the set of ins tructions  fully, it will perform the check-out/check-in 4.
actions  regardless of whether the server received the w ork s t ation’ s  reply and issued a reply back. The
w ork s t ation  also saves a record of the ins tructions,  so it will not execute the same set of ins tructions
twice if the server resends them.
5.For group set check-outs the end user will see the group set in Checking out status. For group set5.
check-in the end user will see the group set as Checked in.
6.Within 10 minutes of the groups unlocking, the idarch service will determine if any local service mode6.
ins tructions  have been sent. The interrupted group set check-out/check-in ins tructions  will be
prepared for resending.
7.During the w ork s t ation’ s  next poll the group set check-out/check-in ins tructions  will be re-sent. The 7.
w ork s t ation  will recognize that the ins tructions  have been performed and resend its reply.
8.Once the server receives the reply from the w ork s t ation,  it will be updated. For group set check-outs 8.
the end user will see the group set as checked out with the Check in button  available to them. For
group set check-in the end user should already be seeing the group set as checked in.
W orkflo w  Manager Service (idwfm)
The W orkflo w  Manager Service ( idwfm ) carries out automated w orkflo w  tasks, and is responsible for
notif ying  the actors in a request (requesters, recipients, authorizers).
For example, when a user makes a request using the View and update pr ofile  (IDR) module, the CGI
program contacts the W orkflo w  Manager Service, which then processes the request and sends out
emails to authorizers. The W orkflo w  Manager Service uses the T r ansaction  Monitor Service ( idtm ) to
run connectors for approved requests.
The W orkflo w  Manager Service is dependent on the Database Service  (on page 2844). If you restart the
database service, you must restart the W orkflo w  Manager Service.
