Manage the system  > Maintenance > System variables  page. System variables that are set in the registry
are listed after  those recorded in the database.11 Changes to the service account (psadmin)
Bravura Security Fabric  utiliz es  a service user (default psadmin ) account in various loc ations.
Or g aniz ations  require the ability to rename this account, use a diff er en t  account or change the password.
When changes are made to the Bravura Security service user (psadmin) account, such as renaming it,
changing the password, or changing to a diff er en t  account, use the serviceacct program to update
known loc ations  where the service user account is used.
If you have multiple  instances using the same service account, you must run serviceacct under each
instance when the service account is modified.  If the service account is a domain account, you must prefix
it with domain name "domain\user" when running the utility .
Usage
Before running serviceacct , navigate to the \<instance>\ directory and run instance.bat to c on figur e
necessary environment variables.
serviceacct.exe [-account] [-password] [-restart] [-noverify]
Argument Description
-account Prompt for a new account ID
-noverify Skip verifying the supplied cr edentials
This is only used when the utility  v erific ation  process
failed and you know the new account/password are valid
-password Prompt for a new password (will not be echoed)
-restart Restart all running services
Examples
1. After  changing the password of the current service user account, run the following command to 1.
update all known loc ations  where the account is used:
   serviceacct -password 
   <NEWPASSWORD>
2. After  changing the user ID of current service user account, run the following command to update all 2.
known loc ations  where the account is used:
  serviceacct -account 
   <NEWUSERID>
3. After  swapping to a new service user account, run the following command to update all known 3.
loc ations  where the account is used:
   serviceacct -account -password 
   <NEWACCOUNTNAME> 
   <PASSWORD>It is recommended to restart all services related to the Bravura Security Fabric instance to make sure
everything is working properly after  you run the utility .
The serviceacct programs stops and starts all currently running services when used with the -
restart option.

b.Create a new login as the new account and set it in the database, according to install ins tructions b.
Bravura Security Fabric  requires a dedicated database, user and schema in SQL Server  in order to
connect to a database and install schema objects.
You can allow Bravura Security Fabric  setup to do this for you, as described in Using setup to
create a new dedicated database user, or use the following ins tructions  to set up the user and
schema yourself.
To create the user and c on figur e  its permissions:
1.Start Micr osoft  SQL Server Management Studio. 1.
2.Connect to the server as a system administrator (sysadmin role).2.
You can do this using SQL Server authentic ation  and the sa account, or using Windows
authentic ation  if the Windows user has the sysadmin role.
For example, to connect to the server using the sa account, set:
Server type : Database Engine
Server name: <host name or IP address> \<instance>
Authentic ation:  SQL authentic ation
Login:  sa
Password <password for sa>
