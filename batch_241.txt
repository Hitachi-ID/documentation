    "retval" = "<N>" # 0 for success; non-zero on error
    "password" = "<password value>" # Optional value for all resources
    "strength" "<policy ID>" = {
        "password" = "<password value>"
    } # Optional; 0 or more groups for each password policy
  }

Allowing users to specify a destination  container
You can c on figur e  Bravura Security Fabric  to use a profile  and request attribut e  to prompt users for the
destination  container when cr eating  or moving accounts on a target system that supports contexts, such
as LDAP Directory Service, NDS, Exchange 2007/2010/2013/2016, and Activ e  Directory.
When the Pr ofile/r eques t  attribut e  to use as the container DN option  is c on figur ed  on the Target system
in f ormation  page ( Manage the system > Resources > Target systems ), users can:
▪Set the destination  container when cr eating  new accounts. ▪
Users do this by setting  the pr ofile/r eques t  attribut e  value in the request form. By default, Bravura
Security Fabric  creates new accounts in the same container as the template. Without the pr ofile/
r eques t  attribut e,  you may need to set up identic al  templates for each container.
If enabled when setting  the target system address, Bravura Security Fabric  can also create a container
if a non-e xisting  one is specified.
▪Move e xisting  accounts on the target system to a diff er en t  container. ▪
Users do this by setting  the To container value – which is actually the pr ofile/r eques t  attribut e,  but
with a diff er en t  name – on the move accounts page. Bravura Security Fabric  only displays the move
oper ation  (the Move button)  for users with accounts that can be moved between containers.
To allow users to select a container for a create account or move context oper ation:
1.Add a pr ofile  attribut e  to provide a place to prompt the user for this in f ormation. 1.
It is recommended that you c on figur e  the pr ofile  attribut e  to have a set of restricted values, so that
the requester or product administrator  can select from a drop-down list.
2.Ensure that you set read/write permissions for the pr ofile  attribut e. 2.
3.Provide a group of users the ”Move user from one context to another” rule.3.
4.Update the Target system in f ormation  page ( Manage the system > Resources > Target systems ) by 4.
typing the name of the pr ofile  attribut e  in the Pr ofile/r eques t  attribut e  to use as the container DN
field.
This allows Bravura Security Fabric  to use the pr ofile  attribut e  for this purpose.2 Implementers
A request can be fulfilled  by a human agent, or implementer , rather than a connector program, where
the implementer is notified  of a request for:
▪An access change request, such as account cr eation,  and carries out the task on a target system. This ▪
can be done, for example, during a phased deployment before automated w orkflo w  is fully
implemented.
▪An inventory item, and delivers the item to the recipient.▪
▪An update on an uncommon target system that does not support some oper ations  using a connector. ▪
▪An update on a target c on figur ed  as read-only. ▪
▪An update on a third-party applic ation  that cannot be targeted directly. ▪
Implementers log into Bravura Security Fabric  and access the Requests  app to act on a task after  a request
has been approved. Once accepted, the implementer can carry out the task, then update its status in the
Requests  app. Implementers can also:
▪Update attribut es,  depending on their access controls ▪
▪Decline the task and let another implementer complete it▪
▪Mark the task as cannot be completed▪
▪Delegate the task to another user▪
When an implementer does not act on time  for a request/task assigned to him, depending on the
c on figur ation  of the system, reminder emails are sent, and the request/task can be escalated to other
users as determined by the esc alation  plugin  (on page 1386).
An implementer who is also an inventory manager is responsible for assigning an inventory item as well
as delivering it to the recipient.
Implementers who are w orkflo w  managers can accept, update, or delegate tasks for any open request.  
Determining implementers
You can assign any user as an implementer for a resource request. Implementers who are also
authorizers may have permission to approve requests and assign resources. Depending on their access
rights (ACLs), they may be able to modify some pr ofile  and request attribut es  if, for example, values are
not known until  the request is being fulfilled.
You can assign implementers in the Resource oper ations  tab for target systems, managed groups, or
template accounts.
Alt ernativ ely  you can determine implementers dynamically by c on figuring  a plugin.
To use a plugin to assign implementers to resources:
1.Log into the Manage the system  (PSA) module and click W orkflo w  > Options  > Plugins . 1.
2.Type the name of the plugin in the IDSYNCH IMPLEMENTER PLUGIN  field. 2.
3.Click Update at the bottom  of the page. 3.There are no shipped plugins for use with this plugin point. A sample script, implementer.psl , is
included in the samples\* directory. See more in f ormation  about writing  a custom plugin
Requirements
The input/output requirements are similar to the authorizer list plugin  (on page 1363). See W riting
plugins  for general requirements.
Ex ecution  points
The plugin is run by the W orkflo w  monitor service ( idwfm ) .
Input
Input passed to the plugin is as follows:
"" "" = {
  "currentresource" = "<resource ID>" # resource ID to be evaluated by the plugin
  "request" "" = { ... } # Request data
  "requester" "user" = { ... } # Requester's data
  "recipient" "user" = { ... } # Recipient's data
}
Output
The output is returned in the following format:
"" "" = {
  "RunAgainInSecs" = "<N>" # Optional -
 Secs to wait before running again
  "errmsg" = ""
  "retval" = "0 | <N>" # 0 = success !0 = fail
  "resource" "<resource signature>" = {
    "extras" = "false|true"
  # false = only use implementers specified
  # true = use in addition to implementers already specified
    "implementer" = "<implementer ID>"
    "implementer" = "<implementer ID>"
  }
}
For example:
"" "" = {
  "errmsg" = ""
  "retval" = "0"
  "resource" "4F12FA11531BCBC574BC4C4295D4872E" = {    "extras" = "false"
    "implementer" = "bob"
    "implementer" = "frank"
  }
}
.
Assigning tasks to implementers
The IDSYNCH IMPLTASK PLUGIN is run after  a request is approved and pending implemen t ation  by
implementer or connector. The plugin output can determines if the resource oper ation  is performed by
connector or implementer.
To use a plugin to determine how a resource task will be completed:
1.Log into the Manage the system  (PSA) module and click W orkflo w  > Options  > Plugins . 1.
2.Type the name of the plugin in the IDSYNCH IMPLTASK PLUGIN  field. 2.
3.Click Update at the bottom  of the page. 3.
Shipped plugins

    "platform" = "<PLATFORM TYPE>"
    "target" = "<Target ID>"
    "memberid = "<Member ID>"
    "impltype" = "<IMPL|AGENT>"
    "operation" = "<Operation ID>"
  }}
Output
The output is returned in the following format:
"" "" = {
  "retval" = "0 | <N>" # 0 = success !0 = fail
  "isimpltask" = "<true|false>"
}
For example:
"" "" = {
  "retval" = "0"
  "isimpltask" = "true"
}
.
Example: Con figuring  implementers
Often  or g aniz ations  will have a Human Resource target that populates Bravura Security Fabric . For
various security and privacy reasons, these targets usually do not not allow Bravura Security Fabric  to
write back to them. However, or g aniz ations  still require an audit trail if the target is updated manually.
In this example you will set up implementers to update a new employee’s in f ormation  on a HR system
after  an account has been created on the AD target. Using Bravura Security Fabric  to initia t e  the request
to an implementer will provide the required audit trail.
Requirements
This example assumes that:
▪Bravura Security Fabric  is installed. ▪
▪An Activ e  Directory target has been c on figur ed. ▪
▪A template account for the AD target has been created.▪
▪A target is c on figur ed  to retrieve data from a Human Resources system. ▪
Configur e  an implementer target
By default, all target system oper ations  are set to be carried out by a connector. You can override
resource oper ations  at the target system, group, and template level. If the oper ation  is set at target-
system-level to be carried out by an implementer, you must assign at least one implementer to the target
system. If you do not do this, requests involving the target system will be put on hold unless
implementers are dynamically assigned by a plugin.
1.Log in to Bravura Security Fabric  as superuser. 1.
2.Click Manage the system > Resources > Target systems > Manually de fined . 2.3.Select the Human Resources target.3.
4.Under the Auto discovery  options  make sure the option  to Allow child resources, including templates 4.
and managed groups, to inherit implemen t ation  c on figur ation  is enabled.
5.Click Update . 5.
6.Click the Resource oper ations  tab. 6.
7.Select Implementer oper ation  for all listed oper ations. 7.
8.Click Update . 8.
Bravura Security Fabric  displays the "Insufficien t  implementers assigned" warning, and includes an
implementers table below the oper ations  table.
Assign individual implementersYou can add individual s t atic  implementers in the bottom  table on the Resource oper ations  page.
Individual implementers assigned at the target system level are inherited by dependent template
accounts and managed groups.
To assign an individual implementer:
1.In the Implementers  table, click Select… 1.
2.Search
  for and select a user. 2.
3.Click Select . 3.
Assign implementers by user class
To assign implementers based on user class:
1.On the Resource oper ations  page, click the User classes  sub-tab. 1.
2.Click Select…2.
3.Select the _GLOBAL_HELP_DESK_ class and click Select . 3.
Bravura Security Fabric  displays an error because you have not mapped the participan ts  in the user
class yet.
4.Under P articipan t  mapping  for USERID, select IMPLEMENTER. 4.
5.Click Update . 5.
Now all members of the _GLOBAL_HELP_DESK_ user class are implementers on the HR system.
Add a new employee
A member of the human resources team logs into the or g aniz ations  HR system and creates a new user
account.
1.Log into the HR system as a user with privileges and create a new account.1.
Bravura Security Fabric  will be triggered to create accounts on various targets. For example, an
account on the Activ e  Directory target. As part of this process, an email address will be generated.
A notific ation  will be sent to the implementers to update the HR system.
Accept the implemen t ation  task
You can now carry out the implemen t ation  tasks:
1.Log in to Bravura Security Fabric  as an implementer. 1.
2.Click the You have 1 request(s) a w aiting  your fulfillmen t  link or the Requests  link. 2.
3.Click on the most recent request.3.
4.Click the Tasks  button  on the action  panel. 4.5.Click Accept . 5.
The task is now assigned to you.
6.Click Home  to return to the main menu. 6.
You should see that the task notific ation  is still there. It will remain until  you update the task’s status.
Carry out the task and update the task status
1.Log into the HR system as the implementer and add the new employee’s email account.1.
2.Log in to Bravura Security Fabric  as the implementer again. 2.
3.Click the There are 1 request(s) a w aiting  your fulfillmen t  link or the Requests  link. 3.
4.Select the most recent request.4.
5.Click Tasks . 5.
6.Click Complete . 6.3 Role Enforcement
Bravura Security Fabric  supports RBAC with role enforcement, to ensure that users have the correct
access to specified  resources. The role enforcement feature works with the following softw ar e:
Softw ar e Purpose
View and update pr ofile  (IDR) module Allows users to request missing entitlemen ts  or
request e x ceptions  for themselves or for other
users.
W orkflo w  Manager Service Handles requests to remove resources, or for SoD
e x ceptions.  The requests can be auto-approved or
reviewed by authorizers.
rbacenforce Lists users who are in de ficit  for a role, and either
adds resources or requests e x ceptions.
You cannot enable role enforcement and aut omatic  assignment at the same time  for managed groups.
Overview of role-based access control
This section  outlines the c on figur able  elements of Bravura Security Fabric  that support role-based access
control.
Roles
Roles de fine  requirements for specified  sets of users. Requirements can be mandatory or optional,  and
may include template accounts, managed groups, and sub-roles. Assigning the role to a user allows the
user to meet the requirements of the role, such as having accounts on certain target systems, or being a
member of certain managed groups. Roles simplify the provisioning of a set of access privileges for
members; for example:
▪New users must have an account on the company’s Activ e  Directory domain. A template account is set ▪
up as a resource member of a role.
New users created and assigned this role have an account on the AD server aut omatic ally  created for
them.
▪Certain members of the Finance department need to be members of the Accounts Payable managed▪
group.
A role is created with this managed group c on figur ed  as a resource member. New users created and
assigned this role are aut omatic ally  made a member of this group.Role enforcement
The role enforcement engine can identif y  users who have excessive or insufficien t  access during auto
discovery , and issue w orkflo w  requests to correct violations;  for example, the role enforcement engine is
triggered where:
▪A user has access to a database system that is role enforced, but has not been assigned the role. The▪
engine can issue a request to remove the resource or grant the user an e x ception  to explicitly have the
resource.
▪Accountants have access to the finance  server, via being assigned a role. A new finance  server is ▪
created, and added by the administrator to the role. Requests are then made to ensure that all users
in the accountant role have the new system resource.
When enabling role enforcement for managed groups, only direct group memberships can be
enforced. The role enforcement engine cannot identif y  users with access due to indirect group
membership, nor will it submit requests to correct any surpluses due to indirect group membership.
Segr eg ation  of duties  rules
Segr eg ation  of duties  rules are used to identif y  e x ceptions  to roles or possible access c on flicts.  Rules are
created that specify c on flicting  resources that a user should not have simultaneous access to. Once the
rules are in place, users in violation  of the rules are aut omatic ally  identified.  Permission to override the
rule is granted on a case by case basis and must be approved.
For example, rules can be set up so that:
▪If a user is a member of two particular  managed groups, then they are in violation  of the rule. In this ▪
case, the two managed groups are set up as resource members of the rule. Users that have
membership in both managed groups will be flag g ed  as in violation  of the rule. Steps can then be
taken to remedy the situation.
▪A restricted set of users are assigned accounts on a particular  server; for example, only certain HR ▪
s t a ff  may have access to the database that contains c on fidential  and sensitiv e  personnel documents.
Nonetheless, there will be situations  where certain individuals require access to resources such that they
violate a segr eg ation  of duties  rule. There is a process so that e x ceptions  to the rule can be applied for
and managed. The e x ceptions  must be authorized and a record of the authoriz ation  is kept.

Aut omatic  resource assignment  (on page 2442) is another feature that supports role-based access
control.
How role enforcement works
The Bravura Security Fabric  role enforcement engine can identif y  users who have excessive or insufficien t
access during auto discovery , and issue w orkflo w  requests to correct violations.  The engine only enforces
roles, resources, and users that are included in the enforcement jurisdiction . It can list unenforced users
who are in violation,  but it takes no action.
