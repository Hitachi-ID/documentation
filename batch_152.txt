Input protocol for plugins commonly includes one or more of the following inner KVGroups:
"requester" "admin—user"  which describes the user whose action  caused the plug-on to run.
"recipient" "user" which describes the recipient of the action,  if there is one. This is a user whose pr ofile
is being managed.
"viewer" "user"  which describes the viewer of the action,  if there is one; for example, an authorizer
reviewing a request.
"model" "user" which describes the model user used in pr ofile  comparison, if there is one.
It is possible for the requester, recipient, and viewer to be the same user.
