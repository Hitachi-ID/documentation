For inventory provisioning, Bravura Identity  uses inventory target systems and templates to allow
inventory items to be included in requests.
You do not need to set up model accounts in order to provision tokens or other inventory; however, you
should create model accounts for an RSA Authentic ation  Manager 7.1/8.2 target system if you want to
set up user accounts with token extension data.
You can add an inventory target system through the Resources menu, or the Inventory menu.
To add an inventory target system:
1.Click Manage the system  > Inventory >Target systems > Manually de fined . 1.
Alt ernativ ely ,  click Manage the System > Resources > Target systems .
2.Click Add new… 2.
3.Enter target system parameters.3.
The target system type can be one of:
▪NULL target system▪
▪RSA Authentic ation  Manager 7.1/8.x ▪
▪Vasco IDENTIKEY Server▪
To provision SecurID tokens, create your inventory target system with the following parameters:
Parameter Setting
ID For example: RSA
Type RSA Authentic ation  Manager 7.1/8.2
Description For example: RSA
List accounts? True

 Allowed in the certific ation
processAllow this target system to be included in a certific ation  process in Access
Certifier .
 Aut omatic ally  create a
Privileged Access Manager
managed systemAllow this target system to be c on figur ed  as a managed system in Bravura
Privilege . Deleting  this target system from the Bravura Privilege managed
systems will remove the ability of Bravura Privilege to reset passwords on the
target system without manual c on figur ation.
This option  is not available for local service mode target systems. You will need
to run target system import rules if you delete this target system from the
Bravura Privilege managed systems and decide to re-manage it.
P r ofile  and account association
Source of pr ofile  IDs Use this to indicate that users of this system should, by default, also be users of
Bravura Security Fabric . This also means that full user names are drawn from
this system.
See Building user pr ofiles  (on page 539) for details.Option Description
Account attribut e  to use as
pr ofile  IDBy default, Bravura Security Fabric  aut omatic ally  uses the short ID on a Source
of Pr ofiles  to de fine  the pr ofile  name. If you want to use a diff er en t  account
attribut e  to create the pr ofile  ID, type the name of the account attribut e  in the
Account attribut e  to use as pr ofile  ID field.  Make sure the chosen attribut e  is
loaded from the target system  (on page 571) and that it is populated for all
accounts with a unique value. The accounts for which this attribut e  is blank or
doesn’t exist won’t create a pr ofile.  If the attribut e  has the same value for more
than one account, no pr ofile  will be created and an error notice  about
"duplicate accounts" will be logged. If the attribut e  has the same value for more
than one account, all of those accounts will be associated with the fir s t pr ofile
to be created (usually in alphabetic al  order).
Aut omatic ally  attach  accounts Select this checkbox if user IDs on the target system are identic al  to those on
Bravura Security Fabric . This allows Bravura Security Fabric  to aut omatic ally
associate accounts owned by the user with their user ID.
See Attaching  accounts  (on page 541) for details.
Account attribut e  to
aut omatic ally  attach  accounts to
user pr ofilesThe attribut e  to use to associate each account with an e xisting  pr ofile.  By
default, Bravura Security Fabric  aut omatic ally  attaches  an account to a pr ofile  if
the account's short ID matches the Pr ofile  ID. If you want Bravura Security
Fabric to use a specific  account attribut e  (rather than the short ID) to determine
auto association,  type the name of the account attribut e  in this field.  Make sure
the chosen attribut e  is loaded from the target system and that it is populated
for all accounts; the accounts for which this attribut e  is blank or doesn't exist
won't be associated with any pr ofile.  If the attribut e  has the same value for
more than one account, all of those accounts will be associated with a single
pr ofile.
Auto discovery
List accounts When enabled (default) the connector generates a listing  of account login IDs
during auto discovery.
This option  is visible only if the target system supports account listing.
List account attribut es When enabled (default) the connector generates a listing  of account attribut es
during auto discovery. By default, only account attribut es  that are mapped to
pr ofile  and request attribut es  are loaded, and all attribut es  are loaded as single-
valued. You can override this behavior for individual attribut es.
In order to use this option  the List accounts checkbox must also be selected.
Bravura Security Fabric  can only list account attribut es  from supported systems.
See Target Systems  in the Connector Pack documen t ation  for details of specific
systems.Option Description
List groups When enabled (default) the connector generates a listing  of groups during auto
discovery.
In order to use this option  the List accounts checkbox must also be selected.
Disabling this option  does not remove any e xisting  managed groups; groups
must be manually unmanaged or they will be shown in the interface with a red
x (invalid) and have zero membership.
Target system supports multiple
owners on groupsWhen disabled (default) a single group owner is supported for a group.
When enabled, multiple  group owners are supported for a group.
List group attribut es When enabled the connector generates a listing  of group attribut es  during auto
discovery.
In order to use this option  the List groups checkbox must also be selected.
See Target Systems  in the Connector Pack documen t ation  for details of specific
systems.
Create pr ofile  IDs from enabled
accounts onlyEnable this to prevent accounts that are disabled on the target system from
being used to create Bravura Security Fabric  pr ofile  IDs. If you use the LDAP
filt er  option  in the target address, this option  is not considered (the LDAP filt er
overrides it)
Use ID filt er s  to include only
certain users and accountsYou can use ID filt er s  to exclude or include certain users and accounts. By
default, an ID filt er  excludes identified  users from Bravura Security Fabric .
When you select this checkbox, all accounts are excluded except those explicitly
included by an ID filt er .
CAUTION: You must also select the Include in system option  when c on figuring
the filt er .
Track account changes Select this checkbox to capture changes on target systems that happen out-of-
band from Bravura Security Fabric . Changes that will be tracked include:
accounts g etting  added and deleted, accounts joining or leaving managed
groups, account attribut e  values being changed, and account association  being
changed.
The tracked changes are viewable in reports as part of each user’s pr ofile
history.
This can also be used in automated user adminis tration .
Track group changes Select this checkbox to capture changes to group memberships on this target
system that happen out-of-band from Bravura Security Fabric . This option  can
also be set for individual managed groups.
The tracked changes are viewable in reports on group membership.
This can also be used in automated user adminis tr ation.
