For example:
To populate the Inventory items list with unassigned tokens from the target system:
Use the listunassigned program to get a list:
listunassigned.exe -targetid RSAAM
This writes a list of available tokens to a file, RSAAM-unassigned.db in the \<ins t ance>\p sc on fig\
directory.
Populate the Inventory items list:
manageinv -add -target RSAAM -type TOKEN -loc NY -state N -
listfile ..\psconfig\RSAAM-unassigned.db
Removing a single item
To remove a single item, -id and -type are required. For example:
manageinv   -rm -id 00000000111 -type TOKEN
Removing multiple  items using criteria
You can use any c ombination  of -type, -loc ation,  -user, or -target to remove all items with those values.
For example:
manageinv -rm -type TOKEN -loc NY
The list files may also be used to remove items found in those files.  For example:
manageinv -rm -target RSAAM -type TOKEN -loc NY -listfile ..\psconfig
\RSAAM.db
manageinv -rm -target RSAAM -type TOKEN -loc NY -listfile ..\psconfig
\RSAAM-unassigned.db
Removing multiple  items using a file
To remove multiple  items, only the -f option  is required. For example:
manageinv -rm -f items.txt
The text file must be in the format:
itemid type
Updating  an item
To update an item in the INVOBJ table, use the -add argument to specify new in f ormation  about the item.
for full details.Product administrators can manually enter individual inventory items using the Inventory item menu in
the Manage the system  (PSA) module. Regular users assigned as inventory managers can manually enter
individual inventory items using the Manage inventory menu.
Getting  started
Before you begin to de fine  inventory objects and states:
▪Set up a placeholder or RSA Authentic ation  Manager 7.1/8.2 target system to manage inventory  (on ▪
page 2657).
▪Add inventory loc ations  and item types  (on page 2667). ▪
▪Add inventory templates  (on page 2668). ▪
De fining  usable inventory states
Bravura Identity  keeps track of inventory items by altering their state in f ormation  in the database or
external source. The following states are available to all inventory items by default:
▪In stock▪
▪Available▪
▪Reserved▪
▪Undelivered▪
▪Assigned▪
▪Outstanding▪
You can enable other possible states to r e fine  the management of certain item types and loc ations;  for
example, you may need a way to track items that are lost, or in repair. The possible states are listed in
Table Inventory states  (on page 2682). In the table, default states are marked with 
 . Figure : Inventory
states and w orkflo w  (on page 2647) illustrates the r elationship  between inventory items, states, and
provisioning w orkflo w .
To enable possible states:
1.Click Inventory > Inventory states . 1.
2.Select the inventory Type and Loc ation  c ombination  that you want to modify inventory states for, 2.
then click Update .
3.On the Inventory states page, select the extra states that you want available by selecting  the 3.
appropriate checkboxes.
4.Click Update . 4.
The following table describes the possible states of inventory items. Default states are marked with a 
 .
Items that are in a Disposed state must be manually deleted by a product administrator  or inventory
manager.
Inventory statesThis state … Means the item is …
Before provisioning
Approved purchase Approved for purchase, but has not yet been purchased and is unavailable
for provisioning
Ordered Approved for purchase and has been ordered, but is not yet in stock and
not available for provisioning.
In stock In stock but not yet available for provisioning.
Provisioning w orkflo w
Available Available for provisioning.
Reserved Selected for provisioning.
Undelivered Assigned but not yet in the possession of its user. The inventory manager
must deliver the item to the user.
In transit to user/received by user Shipped by the inventory manager and is in transit to the user or received
by the user.
Assigned Assigned and delivered.
Removed from user / stock
Outstanding Deleted from a user’s pr ofile  but has not been retrieved from its former
user.
Permanently damaged Damaged beyond repair and is not available for provisioning.
Lost / Stolen Missing and is not available for provisioning.
In repair Being repaired and is not available for provisioning.
Disposed Damaged or no longer needed and removed from stock.
Con figur ation  notes
Users cannot change states in a way that would violate rules by which items are managed; for example,
they cannot change a state from assigned to reserved.
When an item is assigned during an authoriz ation  w orkflo w ,  it is put in a Reserved  state. If the request is
denied, Bravura Identity  moves the item back to an Available state. If approved, the item is:
▪Assigned if inventory managers or implementers are not c on figur ed ▪
▪Undelivered if inventory managers are c on figur ed ▪
An inventory manager must then move the item to Assigned status to acknowledge delivery.
▪Reserved if implementers are c on figur ed ▪
The item is Assigned once the implementer indicates the task is completed.
When c on figur ed  the In transit and Received by user states are used together. The implementer marks
the item as In transit , then the recipient logs in to acknowledge receipt, which marks the item as
Received by user . These states are useful, for example, when items must be mailed to recipients.Inventory managers and product administrator  s can use the Bravura Security Fabric  interface to add items
with the following states (when the state is enabled / usable):
▪Approved purchase▪
▪Ordered▪
▪In stock▪
▪Available▪
▪Lost/Stolen▪
▪Permanently damaged▪
Inventory managers and product administrator s can move items:
From … To …

You can use the manageinv program
Use the manageinv program to add, remove, and update inventory items.manageinv may be used to import assigned and unassigned inventory items from RSA Authentic ation
Manager 7.1/8.2 and Vasco IDENTIKEY Server target systems.
Usage
manageinv [-nooverwrite] -add -id <itemID> -type <type> -
location <location> [-user <userID>] [-notes "<notes>"] [-
target <target>] [-state <state>] [-desc "<description>"]
manageinv -rm -id <itemID> -type <type>
manageinv -rm [-type <type>] | [-location <location>] | [-
user <userID>] | [-target <target ID>]
manageinv -add|-rm [<arguments>] -f <filename>
manageinv -add|-rm -target <target> -type <type> -
location <location> [-state <state>] -listfile <filename>
Commands are de fined  using the following arguments:
Argument Description
-add Adds inventory items to the database, or updates e xisting
entries.
-rm Removes inventory items from the database.
-nooverwrite Checks if the item being added to the inventory already
exists or not. If the item already exists then the record is
not updated.
-id <ItemID> The item ID in Bravura Identity .
-type <type> The type as de fined  in Bravura Identity . The <type> must
be entered in uppercase; for example, -type TOKEN.
-loc <loc ation> The loc ation  as de fined  in Bravura Identity .
-user <userID> The ID of the user assigned to the item.
-notes <notes> In f ormation  to be read by Bravura Identity  users. Must be
enclosed in double quotes.
-desc <description> Optional  description  of the item.
-state <state> The state of the item (see list of available states below).
-target <target ID> Bravura Security Fabric  target system the item belongs
to. The <target ID> must be entered in upper case; for
example, -target RSAAM.
-f <t e xtfile> Uses a file listing  inventory items to be acted upon. See
Adding multiple  items.
-listfile  <t e xtfile> Uses a list file from an inventory type target system for
items assigned to users or from a listing  file generated by
listunassigned for unassigned items. See Adding multiple
items.Adding a single item
To add a single item, the item’s ID, type, and loc ation  are required. For example:
manageinv -add -id 0000000111 -type TOKEN -loc NY
Optional  arguments include:
   [-state <state> | -desc <description> | -notes ‘‘<notes>'' | -user
   <user> |  -target <target>]
Adding multiple  items
To add multiple  items, either the -f or -listfile  options  may be specified.   Specifying the -f option:    When
using -f, only this option  is required. For example:
manageinv -add -f items.txt
The text file must be in the format:
   itemid type location state description notes user target
Where <state> can be any of:
▪N - Available▪
▪V - In stock▪
▪R - Reserved▪
▪U - Undelivered▪
▪A - Assigned▪
▪O - Outstanding▪
▪P - Approved purchase▪
▪o - Ordered▪
▪D - Permanently damaged▪
▪L - Lost/Stolen▪
▪r - In repair▪
▪d - Disposed▪
▪T - In transit to user▪
▪C - Received by user▪
Use "" for any blank fields.  For example, the following text file row adds an unassigned item:
00000000111 TOKEN CALGARY A "rsa token" "Notes for Calgary token" "" TOKEN1
If you specify any of the values for -type, -loc ation,  -user, -notes, or -target, those values can be skipped
in the text file. For example, if you use the options:
-add  -type TOKEN  -notes "" -f items.txt
then the text file would be in the format:itemid location user target
Specifying the -listfile  option:   
When using the -listfile  option,  the -target, -type, and -loc options  are also required.
The -listfile  option  uses the <target>.db listing  file from an inventory type target system to add items that
are assigned to users (such as for RSA Authentic ation  Manager 7.1/8.2 or for Vasco IDENTIKEY Server).
For example:
After  setting  up an RSA Authentic ation  Manager 7.1/8.2 target system, run auto discovery. Use the
r esulting  list file to populate the Inventory items list with the assigned tokens:
manageinv -add -target RSAAM -type TOKEN -loc NY -state A -
listfile ..\psconfig\RSAAM.db
The listing  file for unassigned items may also be used to add items from a listing  file generated by
listunassigned  (on page 3611).
For example:
To populate the Inventory items list with unassigned tokens from the target system:
Use the listunassigned program to get a list:
listunassigned.exe -targetid RSAAM
This writes a list of available tokens to a file, RSAAM-unassigned.db in the \<ins t ance>\p sc on fig\
directory.
Populate the Inventory items list:
manageinv -add -target RSAAM -type TOKEN -loc NY -state N -
listfile ..\psconfig\RSAAM-unassigned.db
Removing a single item
To remove a single item, -id and -type are required. For example:
manageinv   -rm -id 00000000111 -type TOKEN
Removing multiple  items using criteria
You can use any c ombination  of -type, -loc ation,  -user, or -target to remove all items with those values.
For example:
manageinv -rm -type TOKEN -loc NY
The list files may also be used to remove items found in those files.  For example:
manageinv -rm -target RSAAM -type TOKEN -loc NY -listfile ..\psconfig
\RSAAM.dbmanageinv -rm -target RSAAM -type TOKEN -loc NY -listfile ..\psconfig
\RSAAM-unassigned.db
Removing multiple  items using a file
To remove multiple  items, only the -f option  is required. For example:
manageinv -rm -f items.txt
The text file must be in the format:
itemid type
Updating  an item
To update an item in the INVOBJ table, use the -add argument to specify new in f ormation  about the item.
to manage items in any state.
Assigning inventory managers
