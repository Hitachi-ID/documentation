▪Enable persistence for the request.▪
▪Assign the pool for the request.▪
▪Change the "Host" header for the request, setting  it to the address of the Bravura Security Fabric ▪
server that will receive this request.
The exact functionality  of this script may vary depending on the needs of your business, but enabling an
iRule to selectiv ely  handle API tr a ffic  is a minimally -disruptiv e  solution  for supporting  calls to the Bravura
Security Fabric  API.
To enable session persistence for API calls through iRules:
1.Log into the BIG-IP adminis tr ation  UI as an administrator. 1.
2.Navigate to Main > Local T r a ffic  > iRules . 2.
3.Click Create... 3.
4.Assign a unique name for this iRule.4.
5. Con figur e  the iRule to modify API tr a ffic,  by updating  the following packet in f ormation: 5.
▪The HTTP "Host" header must be set to the IP address of the server handling the request.▪
▪The packet must be assigned to a pool, if one was not already assigned.▪
▪A non-cookie persistence pr ofile  must be applied to the packet. ▪
The following iRule example is capable of updating  SOAP API tr a ffic  in order to enable session
persistence through Destination  Address, or "sticky"  persistence:
when HTTP_REQUEST {
if {[HTTP::header exists "SOAPAction"]}{ e-session-persistence
# Set custom persistence profile, as API requests may not support
cookies.
persist sticky 255.255.0.0 3600
# Confirm that members of "Pool1" are available, and set the pool.
if { [active_members Pool1] > 1 } {
pool Pool1
}
# Replace the Host header, as this needs to match the destination
node.
HTTP::header replace Host [LB::server addr]
# log local0. "SOAP request: [HTTP::header value SOAPAction],
sending to: [LB::server addr]."
}
}
when LB_FAILED {
log local0. "Failed pool selection"
}
6.Click Finished  when your iRule is complete. 6.Con figur e  virtual server to enable session persistence
In the F5 LTM load balancer, the "Virtual Server" feature presents a reachable address that network
tr a ffic  can be sent to in order to be load balanced. The F5 LTM’s virtual servers are responsible for
receiving tr a ffic  from both clients and servers, and is responsible for deciding where how that tr a ffic  is
routed. Because of this, the F5 LTM virtual server responsible for Bravura Security Fabric  tr a ffic  must be
updated to enable session persistence, and to make use of the session persistence settings  we de fined  in
previous steps.
To c on figur e  the virtual sever to enable session persistence:
1.Log in to the BIG-IP adminis tr ation  UI as an administrator. 1.
2.Navigate to Main > Local T r a ffic  > Virtual Servers > < Bravura Security Fabric  virtual server > > 2.

10 Locking down a Bravura Security Fabric server
Or g aniz ations  that are either considering deployment of Bravura Security Fabric , or have already
deployed it, need to understand how to secure the Bravura Security Fabric  server. Bravura Security Fabric
is a sensitiv e  part of an or g aniz ation’ s  IT infrastructure and consequently must be defended by strong
security measures.
It is important to protect not only the Bravura Security Fabric  server, but also the sensitiv e  data it stores:
▪Administrator cr edentials  used by Bravura Security Fabric  to connect to target systems. ▪
▪Console user passwords used by the Bravura Security Fabric  administrator to sign into, c on figur e  and ▪
manage Bravura Security Fabric  itself.
▪Passwords to managed accounts on target systems.▪
▪Password history and security question  data for end users. ▪
This chapter is a best pr actices  guide for securing a Bravura Security Fabric  server. The objectiv e  of is to
have a reliable, high availability platform  that is difficult  or impossible to compromise.

Basic pr ec autions
Some of the most e ff ectiv e  security measures are common sense:
▪Use a single-purpose server for Bravura Security Fabric . Sharing this server with other applic ations ▪
introduces more complexity and more administrators, each of which carries its own incremental risk.
▪Use strong passwords for every adminis tr ativ e  account on the server. ▪
▪Maintain a current, well-patched oper ating  system on the Bravura Security Fabric  server. This ▪
eliminates well-known bugs that have already been addressed by the vendor; for example, Micr osoft.
▪ Aut omatic ally  apply patches, especially security patches, to the OS, database server and any third ▪
party softw ar e.
▪Keep the Bravura Security Fabric  server in a physically secure loc ation. ▪
▪Provide security awareness training to all employees.▪
▪Install and keep up to date anti- virus  softw ar e. ▪
▪Do not leave a login session open and unattended  on the Bravura Security Fabric  server’s console. ▪
▪If you are hosting  Bravura Security Fabric  on your own server, attach  the server to a secure, internal ▪
network rather than the public Internet. If access from the Internet is required, mediate it via a
reverse web proxy running a diff er en t  OS an web server platform  than Bravura Security Fabric  –
platform  diversity reduces the risk of zero-day exploits. This is not an issue when using the softw ar e-
as-a-ser vice  (SaaS) option.
▪Regularly review Bravura Security Fabric , OS and network logs. ▪▪Use the Micr osoft  Security Compliance Toolkit to learn more about server hardening. ▪
Physical access and security
Bravura Security Fabric  servers should be physically protected, since logical security measures can often
be bypassed by an intruder with physical access to the console:
▪Restrict physical access▪
Put Bravura Security Fabric  server(s) in a locked and secured room. Restrict access to authorized
personnel only. Product administrators should install and c on figur e  the server(s) and then only access
it remotely via HTTPS to its web portal or RDP to the OS.
▪Connect a UPS▪
Ensure that server power is protected, that graceful shutdowns occur when power is interrupted and
that there is surge pr ot ection  at least on incoming power c onnections.
▪Prevent boot from removable media▪
Con figur e  the server to boot from an internal drive and not from removable media.
Where the Bravura Security Fabric  server is virtualized, apply the above controls to the hypervisor.
Employee training
Security policies are only as e ff ectiv e  as user awareness and compliance. Security awareness training
should include:
1.Building security including authoriz ation  for visitors and ID badges. 1.
2.Password policies, regarding complexity, regular changes, non-reuse and not sharing passwords.2.
3.Social engineering and phishing attack s,  to help users recognize when a person, malicious web site or 3.
email tries to trick them into disclosing access or other in f ormation.
4.The consequences of a security breach, including consequences to users who may have supported the4.
breach through action  or inaction.
5. E ff ectiv e  security pr actices  r elating  to mobile devices, such as laptops, smart phones and tablets. 5.
6.Not leaving endpoints signed on, unlocked and unattended. 6.
Hardening the oper ating  system
Bravura Security requires that Bravura Security Fabric  be installed on the latest Micr osoft  Windows
Server oper ar ating  system. The fir s t step in c on figuring  a secure Bravura Security Fabric  server is to
harden its oper ating  system. The following are sug g estions  on how to lock down the oper ating  system.
Patches
Bravura Security  recommends that or g aniz ations  follow their standard oper ating  patching processes to
promptly download and install all vendor-supplied patches for the OS, DB and web server, as these often
address security problems. There has never been, in Bravura Security  experience, a c ompatibility  problem
with Bravura Security Fabric  caused by such automated patching.Limit logins to only legitima t e  administrators
One way to limit the number of users who can access the Bravura Security Fabric  server is to remove it
from any Windows domain. If the Bravura Security Fabric  server is not a member of a domain, it reduces
the risk of a security intrusion in the domain being leveraged to gain unauthorized access to the Bravura
Security Fabric  server.
▪Remove unused accounts, leaving just psadmin – the Bravura Security Fabric  service account. ▪
▪Create one administrator account to be used by the Bravura Security Fabric  OS administrator to ▪
manage the server and set a strong password on this account.
▪Disable the default administrator account.▪
▪Remove any Guest or unused service accounts.▪
▪Remove the terminal services user account TsInternetUser. This account is used by the Terminal▪
Service Internet Connector License.
For any accounts that must remain, limit their access. At a minimum, block access by members
of ’Everyone’ to files and folders on the server.
Minimize running services
Disable any unused service. This eliminates pot ential  sources of softw ar e  bugs that could be exploited to
violate the server’s security.
Only the following Windows services are required on Bravura Security Fabric  servers:
▪ Applic ation  In f ormation ▪
▪Background Tasks Infrastructure Service▪
▪DCOM Server Process Launcher▪
▪DHCP Client▪
▪Group Policy Client▪
▪Local Session Manager▪
▪Network Store Interface Service▪
▪Power▪
▪Remote Procedure Call (RPC)▪
▪RPC Endpoint Mapper▪
▪Security Accounts Manager▪
▪SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)▪
▪System Events Broker▪
▪Task Scheduler▪
▪TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper▪
▪User Pr ofile  Service ▪
▪Windows Process Activ ation  Service ▪
▪ W ork s t ation▪
▪World Wide Web Publishing Service▪Additional  services should only be enabled if there is a specific  need for them.
Packet filt ering
Open ports are an exploitable means of system entry. By limiting  the number of open ports, you
e ff ectiv ely  reduce the number of pot ential  entry points into the server. A server can be port scanned to
identif y  available services.
Use packet filt ering  to block all inbound c onnections  other than the following default ports required by
Bravura Security Fabric :
Default TCP port Service
443/TCP IIS / HTTPS web service.
5555/TCP Bravura Security Fabric  database service default port
number ( iddb ).
2380/TCP Bravura Security Fabric  file r eplic ation  service default
port ( idfilerep ).
3334/TCP Password manager service ( idpm ).
2340/TCP Session monitoring package g ener ation  service
(idsmpg ).
2540/TCP Discovery service ( iddiscover ).
6190/TCP Privileged access service ( idarch ).
2240/TCP W orkflo w  Manager service ( idwfm ).
2234/TCP T r ansaction  monitor service ( idtm ).
IIS web server
The IIS web server is a required component since it provides all user interface modules. It should
therefore be carefully protected.
IIS is more than a web server; it is also an FTP server, indexing server, proxy for database applic ations  and
a server for activ e  content and applic ations.  Disable these features as Bravura Security Fabric  does not
use them.
Always deploy a proper, issued-by-a-real-CA SSL certific a t e  to Bravura Security Fabric  servers and disable
plaintext HTTP access. Never use a self-signed certific a t e  in a user-facing system, as this may c ondition
users to ignore SSL validity warnings.
Assign the IIS user the right to read from but not write to s t atic  HTML, image file and Javascript files used
by Bravura Security Fabric .
Assign the IIS user the right to execute CGI programs but not other executables on the Bravura Security
Fabric  files y s t em.
Disable directory browsing – there is no reason why a user c onnecting  to the Bravura Security Fabric  web
portal should be able to list files in any folder.Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
Implemented in Bravura Security Fabric 12.6
The default shipped value of the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) HTTP header has been restricted to limit
tr a ffic  to only the IIS Web Server (or load balancer) hosting  the product. There is one e x ception,  a
wildcard (*) in the connect-src policy so that Bravura Security Fabric  works upon ins t allation.  Bravura
Security recommends that the Content-Security-Policy header be further restricted / hardened to replace
the wildcard with only valid hostnames for Bravura Security Fabric . Valid hostnames include the
individual instance hostnames of each server (ex: http s://f abric-ser v er1.c ompan y .c om  and http s://f abric-
ser v er2.c ompan y .c om),  and the main load balancer hostname (ex: http s://f abric.c ompan y .c om),  as well
as any special hosts added to the ALLOWED ORIGINS
A list of hosts separated by comma in use by any server. It is defaulted to localhost and hostname of each
node if unspecified.  The hostname is taken from the database service list under column Address.
system variable ( Manage the system> Maintenance> System variables ).
Example
The Content-Security-Policy header has a number of diff er en t  policies, the one that needs to be further
hardened is connect-src, so leave the rest as they are unless you have a reason to change them. Here is
an example of the hardened policy with the three URLs from the previous paragraph.
Content-Security-Policy: connect-src 'self' https://fabric-
server1.company.com/ https://fabric-server2.company.com/ https://
fabric.company.com/; default-src 'self'; form-action 'self'; frame-
ancestors 'self'; frame-src 'self' https://www.recaptcha.net/; img-src
data: 'self'; object-src 'none'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'
'unsafe-inline' https://www.recaptcha.net/ https://www.gstatic.com/
recaptcha/; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src-elem 'self'
'unsafe-inline'
The CSP can be set in IIS on each server or may be able to be set globally on the load balancer that
rewrites (overwrites) the header. To modify this value in IIS:
1.Open Internet In f ormation  Services (IIS) Manager  on each server. 1.
2.In the left panel expand the server (named the server computer name). 2.
3.In the left panel expand Sites . 3.
4.In the left panel expand the website the product was installed under (defaults to Default Web Site ). 4.
5.In the left panel click on the product instance name. 5.
6.In the center panel double click HTTP Response Headers . 6.
7.In the center panel double click Content-Security-Policy . Edit the value and then click OK. 7.
External ImagesOccasionally external images are used that will need to be added to the CSP as well. Pr ofile  pictures in
user pr ofiles  and the OrgChart can be uploaded (so they are served by the same server as the product),
or can be a link to an external directory of photos. If an external directory is used, the URL must be added
to the end of the img-src  policy, and would look like this:
img-src data: 'self' http://photos.company.com;
T r oubleshooting
Make sure you test the value after w ar d  to ensure Bravura Security Fabric  behaves correctly.
An incorrectly written  policy can result in a white screen (due to no scripts or styles being allowed to
load). There are CSP validators on the internet that you can paste your value into to have it validated.
You will see the following type of error in the Chrome or Edge console when the CSP has been violated,
and that part of the product will not load. Ensure the necessary host names are included.
Refused to connect to 'https://bravuranode2.company.com/bravura/cgi/
ajax.exe?guacamoleplay:guacamoleread' because it violates the following
Content Security Policy directive: "connect-src 'self' https://fabric-
server1.company.com/ https://fabric-server2.company.com/ https://
fabric.company.com/".
Upgrading
When upgrading, you will need compare the custom hardened CSP with the new CSP included in the
upgrade to make sure all the necessary e x ceptions  are included in the policy. Keep the e xisting  CSP
somewhere safe in case the upgrade replaces the CSP .
Read more about the Content-Security-Policy at http s://de v eloper .mo zilla.or g / en-US/docs/W eb/HT TP /
CSP.
SQL Server Database
Each Bravura Security Fabric  server is c on figur ed  with a SQL Server database. Most commonly, the
database server softw ar e  is deployed on the same server as the Bravura Security Fabric  applic ation.  It
follows that the database must also be hardened.
Remove or disable unused services and components
Do not install anything beyond the core SQL server softw ar e.  Specific ally ,  leave out or disable:
▪SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS).▪
▪SQL Server In t egr ation  Services (SSIS). ▪
▪Full-Text Engine.▪
▪The Filter Daemon Launcher.▪
▪SQL Server R eporting  Services (SSRS). ▪
▪ Activ e  Directory Helper. ▪▪SQL Server VSS Writer service.▪
▪SQL Server Browser.▪
Disable TCP/IP access to MSSQL
Bravura Security Fabric  will connect to the database locally, so network access can and should be
disabled. Use SQL Con figur ation  manager to disable all but shared memory access to the database.
Limit access to the database
After  installing the SQL Server database softw ar e  and Bravura Security Fabric , remove access by the OS
Administrators group to the database and change the password for the sa account.
Con figur e  a dedicated, local-admin account for use by The SQL Server Agent service, so that it runs in a
diff er en t  security context than the database itself.
Password and key management
During the ins t allation  of Bravura Security Fabric , ensure that the security c ommunic ation  key
(CommKey) used to encrypt c ommunic ation  between Bravura Security Fabric  servers and other
components on the network has been randomly created. Either create your own or use the default
random key.
You should change the CommKey on a periodic basis. Note, the CommKey is located on all Bravura
Security Fabric  servers, secondary servers, proxy servers, and target systems using transparent password
s ynchr oniz ation  or listeners (anything that calls the Bravura Security Fabric  API). Identif y  all instances of
the CommKey, schedule a change and complete the change, then test and verify that the change was
successfully carried out.
Use a strong password policy for all passwords associated with the use of Bravura Security Fabric . At a
minimum, always use the default password policy provided with Bravura Security Fabric .
Communic ation  defenses
Bravura Security Fabric  sends and receives sensitiv e  data over the network. Its c ommunic ations  include
user passwords, administrator cr edentials,  and personal user in f ormation.
HTTPS
Require HTTPS only c onnections  to Bravura Security Fabric  and deploy real (i.e., not self-signed) SSL
certific a t es  on each server.
Firewalls
If you Internet access to Bravura Security Fabric  is required, protect this access using a fir e w all:
▪Make sure you purchase all network hardware, including the fir e w all,  directly from the manufacturer ▪
or from resellers who are authorized and certified  by the equipment manufacturer.
▪Always ensure the latest firm w ar e  running. ▪▪Shutdown unused physical interfaces on the device.▪
▪Implement access lists that only allow the protocols, ports and IP addresses required and deny▪
everything else.
▪Never use default usernames and/or passwords.▪
▪Monitor outbound tr a ffic  to prevent internal machines from being used to launch a zombie attack  on a ▪
server.
▪Use egress filt ering  to block all tr a ffic  by default, then only allow certain tr a ffic  such as email and the ▪
Web.
▪Consider purchasing a fir e w all  which has three c onnections;  one for the internal network, one for the ▪
Internet and the third for the DMZ.
▪Use NTP to synchronize the time  on the fir e w all.  This will ensure the logs have the correct times t amp s. ▪
▪ Con figur e  the Intrusion De t ection  System on the fir e w all  if available. ▪
Communic ating  with target systems
Avoid sending sensitiv e  data as plaintext:
▪Where possible ensure that c ommunic ations  are encrypted. ▪
For example, if you have an Oracle target system, the default setup for the Oracle client is to c on figur e
unencrypted c ommunic ations  with the Oracle database. Ensure that you c on figur e  encrypted
c ommunic ation.
▪When c ommunic ations  cannot be encrypted, you can: ▪
▪Use a proxy server to set up a secure channel with the primary server.▪
▪Not synchronize the accounts on that target system and ensure that adminis tr ativ e  passwords are ▪
periodically rotated.
Auditing
Audit logs are an important measure to identif y  and analyze suspicious activity .
Since anyone with administrator access to the Bravura Security Fabric  server can alter or remove audit
logs, arrange for periodic archive of audit logs to a diff er en t  server that is managed by diff er en t
administrators.
Bravura Security Fabric  administrators with appropriate privileges can run oper ation  reports.
As part of the Bravura Security Fabric , the Logging Service ( idmlogsvc ) manages logging sessions for a
particular  instance. It captures event messages from Bravura Security Fabric  program e x ecution,  and
writes them to the c on figur ed  log file (idmsuite.log  by default).
The Logging Service ( idmlogsvc ) (on page 2854) also has the ability to write to the Windows events
logs.
Windows also provides various audit logs through the Event Viewer. And IIS provides c on figur able  logging
in f ormation  with W3C Extended Log File Format.
Ensure you review the logs of your network devices, such as the fir e w all,  on a regular basis.
