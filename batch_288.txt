The UPDATE SYSTEM AGENT COUNT option  also controls how many target systems can be listed
simultaneously.
Usage
updproxy.exe -list | -refresh | -rotatelog <N> | -proxy <IP address>/<port>
Argument Description
-list Lists all proxy servers registered with the Bravura Security
Fabric server.
-refresh Copies the latest agents to all proxy servers.
-rotatelog <N> Rotate the log folder for at most <N> rounds.
-proxy <IP address>/<port> Specifies  which proxy servers to refresh.
Unlike updinst , updproxy  cannot  be controlled using a c on figur ation  file. Proxies have diff er en t
requirements compared to full instances. Currently updproxy works based on a hardcoded list of
things that are relevant to proxy instances:
▪Connector Pack (instance or global)▪
▪Some utilities  (updsvcpass, pscp, logutil) ▪
▪\<instance>\script\▪
▪\<instance>\lib\▪
▪\<instance>\idmlib\▪
▪\<instance>\license\▪
▪\<instance>\component\▪
▪Services (idmlogsvc, psproxy)▪
Examples
1.To show a list of currently registered proxy servers, type:1.
updproxy -list
2.To update agents on all the proxy servers, type:2.
updproxy -refresh
3.To update agents on a specific  server, type: 3.
updproxy -refresh -proxy <IP address>/<port>
program, installed on the Bravura Security Fabric  server, pushes updates to the Proxy Service.
▪The psproxycmd ▪
Use the psproxycmd  program to communicate with a Bravura Security Fabric  proxy server which is
running the psproxy  service.
Usage
psproxycmd.exe -server <server> -port <port> [-version] [-
exist<filename>] [-list <filepattern>] [-listmd5 <filename>]
[-download <localfile[remotefile]>] [-upload
<localfile[remotefile]>] [-delete <filepattern>] [-run[i|o]
<command>] [-timeout <seconds>]
Argument Description
-server <server> The name of the proxy server.
-port <port> The port for the proxy server.
-version Prints out the version of the psproxy service.
-exist <filename> Checks if <filename>  exists, and returns the MD5 hash
and last modified  time.
-list <filepattern> Lists directory contents. Uses wildcards.
-listmd5 <filename> Generates a list of MD5s for files and outputs to
<filename>.  The generated file is located on the master
server, and includes a list of proxy server files.  Use ’ -’ to
pipe the list through stdin.
-download < loc alfile  [r emot e file]> Downloads <r emot e file>  from the server and calls it
<loc alfile>.  If <r emot e file>  is not specified,  the value is
the same as <loc alfile>.
-upload <loc alfile  [r emot e file]> Uploads <loc alfile>  to the server and calls it <r emot e file>.
If <r emot e file>  is not specified,  the value is the same as
<loc alfile>.
-delete <filepattern> Deletes file(s)  from the server. Uses wildcards. The
<filepattern>  must be the full file path with escaped
backslashes.
-run[i—o] <command> Runs <command> on the server. Use one or both i and o
suffix es  to specify whether sending/receiving data
through stdin/stdout r espectiv ely .
-timeout  <seconds> Sets the timeout  period for the -run command.
When using psproxycmd -run[i|o] to run programs, escape both quot ations  and slashes. For
example:
psproxycmd.exe -runo "\"C:\\Program Files\\Bravura Security\Bravura
Security Fabric\\default\\service\\idmlogsvc.exe\" -rotatelog 3" -
server mercury -port 3344
When using psproxycmd -delete  to delete files,  escape slashes. For example:
psproxycmd.exe -server mercury -port 3344 -delete "C:\\Program Files\
\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\\default\\util\\a.txt"
Examples

Persistent Connector Service (agtsvc)
The Persistent Connector Service ( agtsvc ) runs connector programs that are enabled for persistent
listing  (on page 510). Persistent listing  allows Bravura Security Fabric  to list changes as soon as they
happen on the domain controller to which the Persistent Connector Service ( agtsvc ) connects.
Persistent listing  is currently available on:
▪ Activ e  Directory DN target systems ▪
▪LDAP targets on Activ e  Directory (see samples \agtdap-adlds-per.cfg if your Bravura Security Fabric ▪
ins t allation  included LDAP connector samples)
The Persistent Connector Service ( agtsvc ) is dependent on the Database Service  (on page 2844)
(iddb ). If you restart the database service, Bravura Security Fabric  will prompt to also restart the
Persistent Connector Service.
If the connector for Activ e  Directory ( agtaddn ) or LDAP ( agtldap ) is updated, either restart
agtsvc_ <instance > or use the agtsvccli client utility  to restart with a full listing.
The service is aut omatic ally  installed on the Bravura Security Fabric  server during setup.
See Persistent Connector Service client utility  (agtsvccli ) usage and examples
The agtsvccli program controls the Persistent Connector Service (agtsvc)  (on page 2874).
Usage
agtsvccli.exe <option>
Argument Description
-c --cookie Cookie value to send to connector. This argument is for
developer use only.
-debug Debug logging is enabled for additional  diagnostics.
-full When s t arting  a list, do not c ontinue  the previous list.
This will result in a full list and load of all data.
-h --help Print out help/usage message and exit
-hid --host <host> Agent service host.
-infolist Shows s t atistic al  in f ormation  in kvgroup format for the
currently running persistent list target.
-i --listid  <ID> ID of the oper ation.Argument Description
--loopcount Set a limit on list processing for the number of
incremental in t er ations  up to the specified  loop count
after  which persistent list will be terminated. Each
it er ation  is determined by the ’Persistent list search wait
time’  target address option.  If not specified,  the default
is ’0’ to run inde finit ely .
-p --port <port> Agent service port
-showlists Show currently running lists.
-startlist Start a list.
-stoplist Stop a list.
-t --t ar g etid  <target> Target system.
-v --version Print out version and exit
Examples
1.To stop listing  on Activ e  Directory target system corpdirectory : 1.
agtsvccli.exe  -endlist -t corpdirectory
2.To make a new full list on corpdirectory : 2.
agtsvccli.exe -startlist -t corpdirectory -full
to control the service.
Discovery service (iddiscover)
The discovery service ( iddiscover ) is the principal service that
▪Runs connector programs to list changes from systems▪
▪Loads discovered data into the database via iddb . ▪
▪Merges and acts on changes.▪
The entities  that principally c ommunic ation  with iddiscover  include:
▪The auto discovery nightly job that handles bulk listing  and discovery ( psupdate ) ▪
▪Incremental discovery events that come from Activ e  Directory and LDAP targets when those ▪
in t egr ations  are activ e.
▪The Bravura Privilege  Local W ork s t ation  service that communicates over a proprietary HTTP API to ▪
provide discovery in f ormation.
▪The W orkflo w  Manager Service ( idwfm ) to propagate changes from an authorit ativ e  target system to ▪
other target systems. See Automated user adminis tr ation  (on page 2424).
The types of in f ormation  provided by discovery sources to the discovery service include:
▪Accounts being created/updated/deleted▪
▪Groups being created/updated/deleted▪
▪Group memberships being created/updated/deleted▪▪Computers being created/updated/deleted▪
▪Subscribers to privileged accounts being created/updated/deleted.▪
This service runs aut omatic ally  and cannot be managed from the web interface.8 In t egr ating  instances
The pxidm  program is shipped with Bravura Security Fabric  12.6 for use on an integrated instance of a
Bravura Security  product older than 8.0; for example, on an ins t allation  of Bravura Pass  6.3. It synchronizes
database changes r esulting  from certain events from another Bravura Security  product ins t allation  to
 Bravura Security Fabric  12.6 ins t allation.
For example, if a user is locked out of Bravura Pass  6.3 after  attempting  to log in with an incorrect
password too many times,  he is also locked out of Bravura Security Fabric  12.6. A help desk user can then
log into Bravura Pass  to unlock the user in both ins t allations.
To use this program you must:
1.Enable the Bravura Security  API Service  (on page 2846) ( idapi ) on the Bravura Security Fabric  12.6 1.
server.
The API Service enables external applic ations,  such as pxidm , to access Bravura Security Fabric  12.6.
2.Install the Bravura Security  SOAP API on the Bravura Security Fabric 12.6 server. 2.
See Bravura Security Fabric  Remote API ( api.pdf ).
3. Con figur e  the other Bravura Security product server to integrate with the Bravura Security Fabric  12.6 3.
SOAP API.
4.Set up event actions  in the other Bravura Security product instance for the events that you want to 4.
trigger changes in Bravura Security Fabric  12.6.
Con figuring  the other Bravura Security product server
Before you begin:
▪Create a product administrator  on the Bravura Security Fabric  12.6 server to connect to the API Service ▪
with, and note the user’s password.
Ensure that the product administrator  has the IDAPI caller right.  (on page 699)
▪Ensure that the API Service is running.▪
Setting  up files  on the other Bravura Securityproduct server
To set up the other Bravura Security  product server to use pxidm and the Bravura Security Fabric  SOAP
API:
1.Copy:1.
▪pxidm from the addons directory on the Bravura Security Fabric  12.6 server to the interface ▪
directory on the other Bravura Security  product server.
▪setpxidm from the addons directory on the Bravura Security Fabric  12.6 server to the addons ▪
directory on the other Bravura Security  product server.
2.Set up registry entries that are used by pxidm to determine where the Bravura Security Fabric  12.6 2.
idapi service is located and how to communicate with it.To do this, execute setpxidm using the following command line arguments:
setpxidm -uri <SOAP Address> -apiuser <console ID> -
password <password>  
where:
uri The HTTP(S) address of the SOAP API of the Bravura
Security Fabric 12.6 server
apiuser The product administratorID used to log into Bravura
Security Fabric  12.6
password The password for the product administrator
See setpxidm
Use the setpxidm program to manage c on figur ation  of pxidm access from the command line.
This program c on figur es  the c onnection  in f ormation  on another Bravura Security product instance server
to access the Bravura Security Fabric 12.6 SOAP API.
Usage
setpxidm.exe -uri <SOAP URL> -apiuser <console ID> -
password <console password>
Argument Description
-uri The SOAP address to the Bravura Security Fabric 12.2.0
SOAP API.

LOADDB NULL IS VALUE Normally, if a user has an account on a target system and that account has
an account attribut e  value that is empty, Bravura Security Fabric will
attemp t  to get an associated attribut e  value from another system. You can
change this by enabling the Manage the system >  Maintenance > Options
> LOADDB NULL IS VALUE  setting.  When this is enabled, Bravura Security
Fabric considers the associated pr ofile  attribut e  value empty; it does not
attemp t  to get an attribut e  value from another system.
