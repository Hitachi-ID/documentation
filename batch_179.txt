The Speech Service can only be installed once on a Phone Password Manager server. If you install a
second instance of Phone Password Manager on the same server, then the Speech Service will be unable
to run on the new instance.
When speech r ec ognition  is enabled, users can enunciate their pr ofile  IDs, new password values, and
perform key recovery strings without having to use the numeric keypad.
To set up speech r ec ognition:
1.On the Phone Password Manager server, copy psynch.speech.psl  and speech.psl from the samples* 1.
directory to the \<instance>\script\ directory.
2.Modify the idtel.cfg  file, located in the <instance>\service\ directory, by changing ScriptName as 2.
follows:
ScriptName = "psynch.speech.psl"
3. Con figur e  the Speech Service. 3.
Modify idtel.cfg  by changing the SpeechService Dll line as follows:
▪For local Speech Service, specify speechapi.dll : ▪
SpeechService "" = { 
  Dll = "speechapi.dll" 
  //Server = <server> 
  //Port = <port> 
  //Timeout = <timeout> 
 }
▪For remote Speech Service, specify speechapix.dll : ▪
SpeechService "" = { 
  Dll = "speechapix.dll" 
  Server = <speech service server name or IP address> 
  Port = <speech service port> 
 }
4.Restart the Phone Password Manager service.4.
Speech r ec ognition  is now c on figur ed  and ready to use. To test speech r ec ognition,  place a phone call to
the IVR server and try to use speech instead of the numeric keypad to enter your details.
Con figuring  the speech service
The Speech Service can be c on figur ed  using the following options,  which are located in the idtel.cfg
file:
Option Description
V oiceActivityDet ectThr eshold Controls the sensitivity  of the input threshold for the
Speech Service. The range of possible values for this
option  is between -54 and +3; the default value is -40.
Lowering the numeric value lowers the input threshold,Option Description
which increases the sensitivity  of the Speech Service.
Raising the numeric value raises the input threshold,
which decreases the sensitivity  of the Speech Service. For
example, a value of -54 recognizes even the quietest
sounds, whereas a value of +3 only recognizes louder
sounds.
SpeechR ec ognitionMode Controls which speech r ec ognition  mode is used. Possible
values:
0 – enables "File based mode", which creates a file in the
temp directory before processing the audio file for
speech r ec ognition.
1 – enables "Stream mode", which does not create a file,
but simply analyzes the stream of audio for speech
r ec ognition.  This was the only mode available in releases
before Bravura Security Fabric  version 8.0.
By default, stream mode is enabled.
KeepIntermediateSpeechFiles Controls whether or not to save the audio files created
when SpeechR ec ognitionMode  is set to "File based
mode." Possible values:
0 – files are not saved; they are deleted after  speech
r ec ognition  is complete.
1 – files are saved in the temp directory: C:\Documents
and Settings\p sadmin\Loc al  Settings\t emp

Call Modes
Call modes de fine  how Phone Password Manager initia t es  telephone calls with users.
There are three diff er en t  call modes in Phone Password Manager:
▪Auto-answer mode▪
▪Inbound mode▪
▪Outbound mode▪
In order to specify a call mode, edit the idtel.cfg  file, and change how the ScriptName  is de fined.
The syntax for each ScriptName entry is as follows:
"<script-name>" = "LineNo|[,LineNo]|[BeginLineNo-EndLineNo]:[mode]"
The call mode can be:
▪a|0 – auto-answer mode ( default mode )▪
▪i|1 – inbound ( call can be answered selectiv ely  ) ▪
▪o|2 – outbound▪
The line mode can also be retrieved and set using global variable ’lineMode’, when c on figuring  the
Psynch.psl call logic script.
Auto-answer mode
Auto-answer mode is the default mode. IVR calls are answered by default, call logic scripts run and audio
plays according to the scripts.Inbound mode
Inbound mode is similar to auto-answer mode, but instead of calls being answered by default, calls are
only answered if the PSLang function  "se tHookOff"  is triggered. This allows calls to be answered
selectiv ely .
The "se tHookOff"  PSLang function  for this call mode is specified  in the psynch.psl script  (on page 1767).
In this example, the inbound call is answered if the callerID is "123":
 if ( $callerID == "123" )
{
  setHookOff();
}
The callerID is one of several global variables that contain in f ormation  about the current call. See
Chapter 16 for details on call logic global variables.
Outbound mode
Outbound mode allows the IVR system to make outbound calls, and is c on figur ed  in the psynch.psl script.
When this is c on figur ed,  the IVR system can forward the call to another phone number. Once the call is
received, it proceeds according to the call logic scripts.
The phone number to which the calls are forwarded is specified  in the psynch.psl script  (on page 1767).
For example:
for( var $i = 0; $i < 30; $i++ )
  {
  sleep( 1000 );
  }
$ret = MakeCall( "9,403-2737373", 30, $errbuf );
log( "MakeCall returned: " + $ret + ", error: " + $errbuf );
In order for outbound mode to function,  idtel.cfg must be modified  as follows:
▪Comment-out the "R egis tr ation"  part of the script. For example, if your c on figur ation  does not include ▪
a proxy server, then the part to comment-out appears as follows:
Registration "" = { 
Server = 10.0.59.100 
Realm = bravurasecurity.com //SIP only 
PhoneNumber = 168 
Password = "168" 
}
▪Set the value of ipSignalPort, which diff er s  depending on the protocol you use: ▪
▪H.323 ("ipProtocolName = 0") – set ipSignalPort to "1720"▪
▪SIP ("ipProtocolName = 1") – set ipSignalPort to "5060"▪▪Modify idtel.cfg to include the following:▪
ScriptNames "" = { 
  "filename.psl" = "2-2:o" 
}
This loads "filename.psl"  from the \<instance>\script\ directory of the VoIP instance, and uses line 2
with Outbound mode. The two numbers specify the range of lines, and o specifies  outbound mode. By
default, this call is included in idtel.cfg , but is commented-out.
Call Transfer
Phone Password Manager can be c on figur ed  to support call transfers on SIP and H323 protocols if it is
c on figur ed  to use Dialogic®  PowerMedia Host Media Processing Softw ar e.
Pr e-c on figur ation
Before the function  "TransferCall" can be added to Phone Password Manager to support call transfers,
you must complete the following c on figur ation:
1.Change the ipDTMFmode setting  in idtel.cfg  (on page 1764): 1.
ipDTMFmode = 6
This enables the DTMF key after  a c onnection  has been established.
2.Install SIP softphone  on the Phone Password Manager server. 2.
3.For t esting  purposes, install SIP softphone  on another Windows machine as well. This machine 3.
receives the transferred call.
Next:
▪ Con figur e  TransferCall for SIP protocol  (on page 1786). ▪
Or,
▪ Con figur e  TransferCall for H323 protocol  (on page 1787). ▪
Con figuring  TransferCall for SIP protocol
To c on figur e  Phone Password Manager to use the SIP protocol:
1.On the Phone Password Manager server, c on figur e  the SIP softphone  to use the "SIP" protocol with 1.
"RFC2833" type.
2.Modify the idtel.cfg  file for "SIP": 2.
ipBindAddress = Auto 
ipSignalPort = 5060 
ipProtocolName = 1 // sip = 1,h323 = 0 
ipDTMFmode     = 6
Add the following script into psynch.psl :if( $digits == "<telephone number|extension number>" ) 
  { 
    $ret = TransferCall( "<Telephone Password Manager server address>", $errbuf ); 
    log( "TransferCall returned: " + $ret + ", error: " + $errbuf ); 
    return 1; 
  }
To test the c on figur ation:
1.Call the Phone Password Manager server using the SIP softphone. 1.
2.When prompted for the user ID, type the telephone number or extension number that you want to2.
transfer to, followed by the # sign. For example, 123# .
3.From the other machine with SIP softphone  installed, pick up the line and listen. 3.
Con figuring  TransferCall for H323 protocol
To c on figur e  Phone Password Manager to use the H323 protocol:
1.On the Phone Password Manager server, c on figur e  SIP softphone  to use the "H323" protocol type. 1.
2.Modify the idtel.cfg  file for "H323": 2.
ipBindAddress = Auto 
ipProtocolName = 0 // sip = 1,h323 = 0 
ipDTMFmode     = 6
Add the following script into psynch.psl script:
if( $digits == "<telephone number|extension number>" ) 
  { 
    $ret = TransferCall( "TA:<Telephone Password Manager server address>", $errbuf ); 
    log( "TransferCall returned: " + $ret + ", error: " + $errbuf ); 
    return 1; 
  }
To test the c on figur ation:
1.Call the Phone Password Manager server using the SIP softphone. 1.
2.When prompted for the user ID, type the telephone number or extension number that you want to2.
transfer to, followed by the # sign. For example, 123#.
3.Check the Phone Password Manager log file. The message "TransferCall API called" should be 3.
included, indic ating  that the api was triggered.
Bridge Transfer
Phone Password Manager can connect two phone lines to each other, which is known as a bridge
transfer, hairpin transfer, or supervised transfer call. You can c on figur e  bridge transfers in two ways:▪Both the end-user and the help desk user call the Phone Password Manager system, and the system▪
connects their calls together. For details, see the bridge-demo1.psl sample script.
▪Only the end-user has to call the Phone Password Manager system. The system then makes an▪
outbound call to a help desk user. For details, see the bridge-demo2.psl  sample script.
The scripts bridge-demo1.psl and bridge-demo2.psl are located in the samples directory.
Phone Password Manager currently supports bridge transfers using both Dialogic® voice boards and
Dialogic® PowerMedia Host Media Processing Softw ar e.
Once the system is able to complete bridge transfers, it works as follows:
Line A:
1.The end-user calls the Phone Password Manager system and authentic a t es. 1.
2.The end-user presses a key to request the help desk.2.
3.The end-user is placed in queue.3.
4.The end-user’s status in the queue is updated until  a help desk user becomes available. 4.
5.The two lines are bridged together.5.
Line B:
1.The help desk user either:1.
▪Calls the Phone Password Manager system and checks the queue for help requests.▪
Or,
▪Receives a call from the Phone Password Manager system.▪
2.The system reports the end-user’s in f ormation,  and the help desk user either: 2.
▪Accepts the request for help▪
Or,
▪Places the request back in the queue; the call maintains its position  in the queue. ▪
3.If the help desk user accepts the request, then the two calls are bridged together.3.
4.The system waits until  the line is dropped. 4.
If required, the c on versation  can be recorded. See Recording bridge transfers for details.
Pr e-c on figur ation
Before the bridge transfer function  can be added to Phone Password Manager, you must change the
ipDTMFmode setting  in idtel.cfg:  (on page 1764)
ipDTMFmode = 6
This enables the DTMF key after  a c onnection  has been established.
If you are using a softphone,  then you must:
1.Install the softphone  on the Phone Password Manager server. 1.2.Install the softphone  on another Windows machine as well. This machine receives the transferred call. 2.
Next:
Con figur e  bridge transfers  (on page 1789).
Con figuring  bridge transfers
If you are c on figuring  the bridge-demo2.psl  script, then you must specify the help desk number as
follows:
var $HelpDeskNumber = "SIP:<Server IP>";
Where:
▪<Server IP> is the IP address for the outbound call to the help desk user. This address should connect▪
to the softphone  which can receive a call from Phone Password Manager.
Modify the idtel.cfg  file as follows:
▪bridge-demo1.psl:▪
ScriptName = "bridge-demo1.psl"
▪bridge-demo2.psl:▪
ScriptName = "bridge-demo2.psl" 
ScriptNames "" = { 
   "bridge-demo2.psl" = "4-4:o" 
}
Where: 4-4:o specifies  to only use line four in outbound mode.
The two numbers specify the range of lines, and o specifies  outbound mode.
Recording bridge transfers
You can record a call that has been transferred to the help desk by a bridge transfer. This function  is
controlled by the recorder-demo.psl  script, which is located in the samples directory. The recorded
call produces a wav file.
This script is provided to help test the bridge transfer function  (on page 1787).
Both sides of a call (caller and automated voice) are recorded. However, it is possible to write a script to
record the callers on two diff er en t  lines. The "RecordFileEx" function  has the ability to record two time
slots simultaneously.
To c on figur e  call recording, you must modify idtel.cfg  to assign an outbound mode channel for
recorder-demo.psl and to start the recording. It is recommended that you do so under guidance
from Bravura Security s t a ff .Con figur ation  notes
Optionally ,  you can c on figur e  the bridge transfer script to play on-hold music or other programming while
a user is w aiting  in queue. See bridge-demo1.psl  or bridge-demo2.psl  for details.
HTTPS Encr yption
Phone Password Manager and Bravura Pass  support HTTPS c onnections.
To c on figur e  Phone Password Manager and Bravura Pass  to use HTTPS:
1.Install the "Certific a t e  server" role on the Bravura Pass  server. 1.
2.Issue an SSL certific a t e  and enable HTTPS on the Bravura Pass  server. 2.
3.Modify \<ins t ance>\idapiser vice\W eb-SSL.c on fig  to replace <instancename> with your instance name 3.
in the <appSettings>  section.  For example:
<add key="instanceName" value="<instance>" />
Be sure to use W eb-SSL.c onfig,  because it contains additional  HT TPS-specific  inf ormation  that is not
found in W eb.c onfig.
4.Verify the HTTPS setup is correct by opening the following link in a web browser:4.
http s://<hos t  server>/<Instance>/idapi
If the setup is incorrect, you are notified  by an e x ception  or error message.
5.Install Phone Password Manager on another server.5.
6.Place a call using the IVR system to test Phone Password Manager functionality . 6.
