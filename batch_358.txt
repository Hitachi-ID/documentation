Failed c ommunic ation
When the proxydelaycalculator  is unable to communicate with a proxy server found on the list,
it will only attemp t  to set the proxy server list on systems that do not already have it c on figur ed.  It will
not calculate and set all specified  target systems’ proxy lists. This is to prevent accidentally o v er writing
the proxy list when a temporary network failure occurs, thus possibly causing a target system to be
c on figur ed  with a sub-optimal  list.
pstee
Use pstee  to debug an executable by logging its stdin , stdout , and stderr tr a ffic.
It is strongly recommended that you use this program only under the dir ection  of a Bravura Security
support technician.psupdate
The psupdate program initia t es  and controls the auto discovery process. It is responsible for calling a
series of programs and PSLang scripts, which in turn, control e x ecution  of each auto discovery task.
These tasks include:
▪Refreshing proxy servers▪
▪ Listing  in f ormation  from managed systems ▪
▪Evaluate the import rules on discovered systems and accounts and assign them to managed system▪
policies
▪Monitoring list file size ▪
▪ Con figuring  listed computer objects as Bravura Privilege resources ▪
▪ Updating  the Bravura Security Fabric database ▪
▪ De t ecting  out-of-band changes ▪
▪Cleaning up the database▪
▪Checking inventory levels▪
▪Loading user class cache▪
▪ Submitting  aut omatic  assignment requests ▪
▪Synchronize server files and registry keys ▪
▪ Notif ying  the Bravura Security Fabric administrator of errors or warnings ▪
▪ Cr eating  the default scheduled task to run psupdate ▪
You can also run psupdate to update a single user.
Never run psupdate on more than one replicated Bravura Security Fabric server at the same time
In a replic ation  environment, the sending node creates additional  queue files in the <ins t anc e>/db/
replic ation  directory. These are used to store the data to be sent to all replic ation  nodes. Once this data
has been replicated to the nodes, these files are removed.

target TARGET1  -target TARGET2queue flush
Use the queueflush program to gracefully shut down all Bravura Security Fabric  services, with the
e x ception  of Database Service ( iddb ) and Logging Service ( idmlogsvc ), on every r eplic ation  node (or
a set list of servers). The command initia t es  the DB_COMMIT_SUSPEND state; in which database commits
are suspended. This is followed by a flushing  of all data in r eplic ation  queues. The program will display
the progress of the flushing  process.
The standard way to reverse the DB_COMMIT_SUSPEND state is stop the Database Service on all nodes
after  queueflush has done its work. If this is not done, you will encounter problems when s t arting
the other services while still in DB_COMMIT_SUSPEND state.
Usage
queueflush.exe [ -cancel | -list |  -servers --servers <serverlist> ]
Argument Description
-cancel Cancel a flush  and lift DB_COMMIT_SUSPEND. See notes
below.
-list List servers in a r eplic ation  environment.
-servers, --servers <serverlist> List of servers to flush  queues on. If this argument is not
specified,  queues from all servers will be flushed.
WARNING!: This option  is not recommended, as servers
that are in a flush  state may still be receiving data from
other servers that are not in a flush  state. Use at your
own risk.
Examples
1.To flush  queues from all r eplic ation  nodes: 1.
queueflush.exe
This command shuts down the services (except the Database Service and Logging Service) and
initia t es  the DB_COMMIT_SUSPEND state. No arguments are needed.
2.To cancel an in-progress queue flush  initia t ed  flush  and DB_COMMIT_SUSPEND state: 2.
 queueflush.exe -cancel
3.To list all servers in a r eplic ation  environment: 3.
 queueflush.exe -list
Notes on -cancel argument  
The queueflush.exe -cancel  command can be used to cancel the process initia t ed  by
queueflush ; for example, if there is much more data in the r eplic ation  queues than expected and the
queues will not be flushed  in reasonable time  for a change window, and there is a need to abort.
For queueflush.exe -cancel  to work, the Database Service and Logging Service should be
running. If the Database Service is not running, it will not work.When queueflush.exe -cancel  is executed (from a single node) it lifts the
DB_COMMIT_SUSPEND state and gracefully starts all the Bravura Security Fabric  services on all replicated
nodes in the instance.
resetkey
Use the resetkey program if you need to reset the c ommunic ation  key (on page 406) (or Master Key),
Connector encr yption  key, or IDMLib encr yption  key in the registry.
For example, if you have f or g otten  any of the encr yption  keys, or if you have a policy which requires you
to change it on a regular basis.
Updating  the registry must occur on all servers, including listeners, proxy servers, applic ation  instance
servers, IDDB r eplic ation  nodes, and transparent password s ynchr oniz ation  triggers. If this change is not
completed on all servers, then c ommunic ation  between these servers can fail. You can export the reset
encr yption  keys to the idmsetup.inf  file, which is used to load in f ormation  during the initial
ins t allations  on these servers.
Usage
resetkey.exe -type <keytype> -value <keyvalue>
resetkey.exe -type <keytype> -export [-value <keyvalue>] [-file <file>]
Argument Description
-type <keytype> The key type for the encr yption  key that is being reset.
Valid types are:
commkey
connectorkey
idmlibkey
restapikey (export only)
-value <keyvalue> The hexadecimal key to set for the new value for the key
as specified  for -type in the registry, idmsetup.inf file, or
other specified  file. The specified  <keyvalue> must be 64
hexidecimal characters in length.
-export Copies the registry value for the specified  encr yption  key,
encodes it, and writes it to the inf file.Argument Description
- file <file> Allows you to specify the name and loc ation  of an
alternate inf file to which to export the encrypted key
value. The default name and loc ation  is <ins t ance>
\p sc on fig\idmse tup.in f .  The encr yption  key value can be
taken from the registry, or specified  using the -type and -
value arguments.
Examples
1.To update the c ommunic ation  key (or Master Key), Connector encr yption  key, or IDMLib encr yption 1.
key in the registry with a specified  hexidecimal key, type:
resetkey -type commkey -value <64-character-key-value> 
resetkey -type connectorkey -value <64-character-key-value> 
resetkey -type idmlibkey -value <64-character-key-value>
2.To update the c ommunic ation  key (or Master Key) in a file named idm-copy.inf, located in the current 2.
directory, using the c ommunic ation  key (or Master Key) value from the registry, type:
resetkey -type commkey -export -file idm-copy.inf
The specified  inf file must be a valid setup file that follows the format of idmsetup.inf. It is
recommended that you backup the inf file before e xporting  the current c ommunic ation  key (or Master
Key) to the file.
serviceacct
Bravura Security Fabric  utiliz es  a service user (default psadmin ) account in various loc ations.
Or g aniz ations  require the ability to rename this account, use a diff er en t  account or change the password.
When changes are made to the Bravura Security service user (psadmin) account, such as renaming it,
changing the password, or changing to a diff er en t  account, use the serviceacct program to update
known loc ations  where the service user account is used.
If you have multiple  instances using the same service account, you must run serviceacct under each
instance when the service account is modified.  If the service account is a domain account, you must pre fix
it with domain name "domain\user" when running the utility .
See Changes to the service account  (on page 2883) for details.
servicemove
The servicemove failover program helps transfer a failed server’s workload to a secondary server.
The program is run from the secondary server.
For example, upon ins t allation,  each W orkflo w  Manager Service (idwfm) is assigned a unique ID on each
server. Each W orkflo w  Manager Service (idwfm) handles only the IDs assigned to it. A w orkflo w  request,
when created, is bound to one of these IDs. So if one of the servers goes down, servicemove can beused to transfer the down W orkflo w  Manager Service to an activ e  server, so that the requests bound to
this W orkflo w  Manager Service service could be processed.
Usage
servicemove.exe [options] ...
Argument Description
-force Forces a move to occur even when the remote service
appears to be running.
-list <server ID> Specify a server ID to list services for that server, or you
can specify "all" to list services for all servers.
-move <service name> Moves the specified  service to this server.
-release <service name> Releases the specified  service back to its home server.
-server <serverID> Specifies  the home server of the service.
Examples
1.To list services on all servers:1.
servicemove.exe -list all
2.To make the secondary server take over running the Password Manager service (idpm) on behalf of a2.
failed primary server, and put all the requests in queue:
servicemove.exe -server <primary server id> -move idpm
3.To force a secondary server to take over running the Password Manager service even though the3.
primary server is currently running:
servicemove.exe -server <primary server id> -move idpm -force
4.To release the Password Manager service back to its home server:4.
servicemove.exe -server <primary server id> -release idpm
setup_iis
Use setup_iis  to modify the Internet In f ormation  Services (IIS) c on figur ation  for a Bravura Security
Fabric  instance. Normally, the installer for Bravura Security Fabric  will handle adding or removing the
c on figur ation  when installing or uninstalling the product. However, in the event of an installer error,
setup_iis  can be used to perform these oper ations.  In addition,  setup_iis  can be used to
c on figur e  response headers using customized meta tags.
setup_iis  must be run from within the directory of the installed instance.
Usage
setup_iis [-i] | -pwd <password> | -r
Option Description
-i Install oper ationOption Description
-pwd Password of the account ID used to run Bravura Security
Fabric services
-r Remove oper ation
Examples
1.To install the IIS c on figur ation: 1.
setup_iis -i -pwd accountpwd1234
2.To uninstall the IIS c on figur ation: 2.
setup_iis -r
3.To c on figur e  response headers, copy the setupiis.cfg  file from the instance's samples directory 3.
to its p sc on fig  directory. Open the copied setupiis.cfg  in a text editor, and modify it for the tags
to be added. Then, run setup_iis  as you would to install the IIS c on figur ation.
updextdb
Use the updextdb  program to generate a new extdb.db  file, or upgrade an e xisting  file with internal
tables.
Usage
 updextdb.exe [initrefbuild]
Examples
1.To create a new extdb.db file, or upgrade an e xisting  extdb.db file: 1.
updextdb.exe
2.To run reference build initializ ation  scripts for external data store, replacing e xisting  contents: 2.
