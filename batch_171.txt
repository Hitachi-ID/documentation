Use the following utilities,  shipped with the Password Change Notific ation  Module, to help write the
c on figur ation  file:
user attr s
Use the userattrs program to query account attribut es  in Micr osoft  Activ e  Directory; to find specific
useful attribut es  that may be used as search criteria in designing the intcptsvc c on figur ation  file.
This program is installed by intcpt.msi  or intcpt-64.msi  on a Windows transparent password
s ynchr oniz ation  trigger system and can be found in the following directory:
<Program Files path>\Bravura Security\\Password Filt er\util\
See userattrs usage in f ormation.
userattrs.exe [-p <ADsPath> ] [-a <attributes>] [-
c <admin account> <admin password>] [ -f <ADsSearchFilter>] -
u <accounts>
Argument Description
-p, --adspath <ADsPath> Specify the domain path (ADsPath). Available macros are
%PDC%, %DC%, %DN%. The default is LDAP://%DC
%/%DN%.
-a, --attribut es  <attribut es> Specify the attribut es  to query, separated by a space. If
none are specified,  all attribut es  are queried.
-c, --cr edential  <admin account> <admin password> Specify administrator account and password separated
by space. If no cr edentials  are specified,  the security
context of the current process is used to bind the object.
-p, -- filt er  <filt er> Specify the account searching criteria (ADsSearchFilter).
The default is sAMAccountName=%USER%.
-u, --users Specify the users’ accounts to query, separated by a
space.
Examples
For example:
userattrs.exe -a DisplayName distinguishedName -u brownwireturns:

verifycfg
Use the verifycfg program to verify that a given account will be bypassed by password strength
checking and/or s ynchr oniz ation,  according to per-target criteria set in the specified  intcptsvc
c on figur ation  file. Neither actual account strength checking, nor s ynchr oniz ation,  is performed by this
utility .  This tool is useful for verifying whether the c on figur ation  file is designed properly before putting
the interceptor online.
This program is installed by intcpt.msi  or intcpt-64.msi  on a Windows transparent password
s ynchr oniz ation  trigger system and can be found in the following directory:
<Program Files path>\Bravura Security\\Password Filt er\util\
See verifycfg usage in f ormation.
 verifycfg.exe  [-c <file>] [-l <level>] -u <user>
Argument Description
-c, --cfg <cfg> Specify the intcptsvc c on figur ation  file. The default is
intcptsvc.cfg
-l, --level <N> The debug level 1-6. The default is 4.
-u, --user The user to be v erified  (required).
Examples
For example:
verifycfg.exe -c ..\service\intcptsvc.cfg -u qa1000 -l 4
returns:
Loading service configuration file:[..\service
\intcptsvc.cfg]...succeeded.
Retrieve user:[qa1000]'s attributes and evaluate settings...
User: qa1000
Session has been created successfullyTarget: End_Users --
 None bypass      <<== It means this account will be strength checked and synchronized against 'End_Users' target
Retrieve target: [End_Users], user: [qa1000]'s status...( FindUser )
If return code belongs set [( 100 )] will be treated as strength check failed
Target: [End_Users], user: [qa1000]'s status = 200, message = userid=qa1000 username=qa 1000
Returned [200] [userid=qa1000 username=qa 1000], strength check will be successful    <<== The account was found in Pass through idpm.
Target: Admin_Users --
 Bypass both strength check and synchronization <<== It means this account will be NOT strength checked and synchronized against 'Admin_Users' target
If the debug level is greater than 4 (default), verifycfg returns more detail on how the account falls
into which categories.
.Unix trigger
This chapter shows you how to set up transparent s ynchr oniz ation  with a Unix-based trigger system.
Bravura Pass  can intercept in t er activ e  password changes on a Unix server using one of two methods:
▪Replacing the nativ e  password program (/usr/bin/passwd) with pspasswd to intercept password ▪
changes made using the standard password command ( passwd ).
This method is considered more robust and is less likely to cause side e ff ects  due to non-standard
c on figur ations.
▪ Con figuring  the Bravura Pass  pluggable authentic ation  module (PAM) on Solaris, HP-UX, and Linux ▪
systems to intercept password changes made by any authentic ation  program. Normally, all
authentic ation  goes through the PAM, including passwd.
This method allows Bravura Pass  to intercept any password change, including password changes
where the regular password program is not used.
These PAM modules are not shipped with Connector Pack 4.6 or newer. Support can be provided at
additional  cost.
Before you begin, ensure that you have researched and carried out the steps outlined in Implementing
Transparent Password S ynchr oniz ation  (on page 1659).
To set up transparent password s ynchr oniz ation  with a Unix-based system:
1. Con figur e  the API SOAP Service. 1.
2.If you are using SSL, ensure that a c ompatible  version of OpenSSL (1.1.x) is installed on the Unix 2.
system.
3.If you did not select the Unix Ins t allation  Packages when you installed the Connector Pack, install the 3.
psunix ins t allation  package.
4. Con figur e  transparent s ynchr oniz ation  by: 4.
▪Replacing the nativ e  password program (/usr/bin/passwd) ▪
or
▪ Con figuring  the Bravura Pass  PAM ▪
These steps are detailed in the following sections.
Con figur e  the API SOAP service
The psunix pspasswd and pspam interceptors installed with Connector Pack 2.1 or later use the
API SOAP Service. These interceptors require Bravura Security Fabric  8.1 or higher.
To use the API SOAP Service:
1.Ensure the API SOAP Service is set to aut omatic  and started. See the API SOAP Service chapter in the 1.
"Reference Manual" for more in f ormation.
2. Optional : Ensure the messages are encrypted, by c on figuring  the API SOAP service and IIS server to 2.
listen and communicate over SSL.3.Recommended : Create a new administrator with adminis tr ativ e  privileges to connect to the Bravura 3.
Security Fabric  API for the remote c onnections  used by the UNIX trigger.
By default, Bravura Security Fabric  includes the _API_USER user. By default, this administrator is only
available for shared memory c onnections  to the API that do not require a password.
The new IDAPI caller must be assigned a password before it can be used for remote c onnections.
a.Click Manage the system > Security > Access to product features > Individual administrators . a.
b.Click Add new... . b.
c.Enter a value for the ID (for example: UNIXAPI) and Name.c.
d.Enter a password and c on firm  the password. d.
e.Add the IP Address of the trigger system in the CIDR not ation  to the Allowed network addresses e.

transparent s ynchr oniz ation.
Install the psunix ins t allation  package
The psunix archive package contains the Unix Listener and other tools and files used to perform
Bravura Security Fabric  oper ations  on Unix systems. There are versions for each type of supported Unix
system. The packages are installed in the unix directory when you choose a complete Connector Pack
ins t allation,  or select them as part of a custom ins t allation.
To install the package on a Unix system:
1.If you did not select the Unix Ins t allation  Packages  when you installed Connector Pack, run the 1.
setup from the main softw ar e  ins t allation  to modify your instance.
The setup program displays the Select an instance to c on figur e  page.
a.Click Connector Pack 64-Bit . a.
b.Click Modify . b.
c.Choose Change. c.
Ensure that the select 
  icon is selected for Unix Ins t allation  Packages , and the appropriate
packages, on the component selection  page.Click Change , then complete the ins t allation  procedure.
2.Copy the psunix-<os>.<cpu>.tar.gz  file from the unix directory to a scratch directory, such 2.
as /tmp/, on the Unix server.
3.Log into the Unix server with adminis tr ativ e  privileges, and extract the files from the psunix 3.
archive. For example, type:
     cd /tmp 
     tar -zxvf psunix-solaris10.sparc64.tar.gz
See Connector Pack Documen t ation  for more in f ormation  about installing psunix .
Replace the nativ e  password program
To e ff ectiv ely  intercept all password changes made using the regular password program on Unix
(/usr/bin/passwd), you can install a replacement password program and a matching c on figur ation  file
(psunix.cfg ) on every Unix server where users might change their local or NIS/NIS+ passwords. See
notes about s ynchr oniz ation  in an NIS / NIS+ environment  (on page 1718).
The Bravura Security password replacement program (pspasswd) applies password strength rules de fined
on the Bravura Pass  server to all new password selections.  It uses the old, renamed, password program
to implement the password change locally on the Unix server, and then forwards a request for
s ynchr oniz ation  to the Bravura Pass  server.
Alternately, you can c on figur e  the Bravura Pass  PAM  (on page 1711) to intercept password changes made
by any authentic ation  program, including passwd.
Install pspasswd on the Unix trigger system
To install Bravura Security password replacement program:
1.Note the c ommunic ation  key (or Master Key). 1.The CommKey value is encrypted in Bravura Security Fabric . If you did not record the key in a secure
loc ation,  copy the idmsetup.inf file from <instance> \ p sc on fig \ on the Bravura Security Fabric
server to the same loc ation  as the installer. The installer will extract the Communic ation  Key value
from the file.
2.Note the product administrator and password to connect to the API SOAP Service.2.
3.Note the URL of the API SOAP Service.3.
4.If you did not select the Unix Ins t allation  Packages  when you installed the Connector Pack, install the 4.
psunix ins t allation  package  (on page 1707).
5.Run the ins t allation  shell script in: 5.
▪ In t er activ e  mode  (on page 1709) ▪
or
▪ Non-in t er activ e  mode  (on page 1710) ▪
Install pspasswd in t er activ ely
Installing in t er activ ely  takes less pr epar ation  and allows you to specify settings  during ins t allation.  You
can use the idmsetup.inf c on figur ation  to pass through some of the in f ormation  as defaults.
To in t er activ ely  install pspasswd on the Unix system:
1.Run the shell script install.sh from the root of the ins t allation  package: 1.
sudo sh install.sh  [ -inf <path>/idmsetup.inf ] [ -
inst <instancename> ]
where:
Option Description
-inf Specifies  the path to the idmsetup.inf file. If omitted,
you must enter c ommunic ation  key (or Master Key)
and other in f ormation  when prompted.
-inst Specifies  the instance name for loc ation  of the psunix
files.  If omitted,  files are copied to the /usr/local/
psunix/default instance  (on page 1711).
2.Follow the ins tructions  displayed by the installer script. 2.
In the ins t allation  process:
a.Allow system files to be backed up. a.
b.Select the "Passwd Transparent Synch" ins t allation  option. b.
c.If you want to use the c on figur ation  options  that exist in /etc/psunix.cfg, type Y when asked. If you c.
want to change the values, type n.See the Connector Pack Documen t ation  or more in f ormation  about the Unix listener.
d.Enter the target ID of the target used to target this system.d.
e.Enter the URL of the API SOAP Service.e.
f.Enter a proxy URL if you are using a proxy. Press [Enter]  if you are not using a Proxy. f.
g.Enter the proxy user name if you are using a proxy. Press [Enter]  if you are not using a Proxy. g.
h.Enter the proxy user name’s password if you are using a proxy. Press [Enter]  if you are not using a h.
Proxy.
i.If you are using SSL, enter the path holding the CA certific a t e(s).  Press [Enter] if you are not using i.
SSL.
j.If you are using SSL, enter the certific a t e  details. Press Enter if you are not using SSL. j.
k. De fine  the [libcurl] path or press Enter to use the system default libcurl library. k.
l. De fine  the [ignore] or press Enterto use the default value. l.
m. De fine  the user name for login to the IDAPI service. m.
n. De fine  the password for the IDAPI user. n.
The installer renames the old password program to <program name>.bin and replaces it with
pspasswd .
Install pspasswd non-in t er activ ely
The installer’s non-in t er activ e  mode allows you to perform unattended  ins t allations.  This would be
advantageous where you want to install on many systems over SSH, for example. This mode requires you
to write a response file that is used with a command line option.
To install pspasswd non-in t er activ ely:
1.Edit the following sections  of the psunix-responsefile.cfg in the root of the ins t allation 1.
package:
