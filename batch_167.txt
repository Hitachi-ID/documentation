Transparent s ynchr oniz ation  requests can also be handled by a load balancer. Though no specific  load
balancer is endorsed for this purpose, the following criteria for its c on figur ation  apply:
▪No heartbeat should be done on either of the ports used by idpm . Use loadbalancerstatus to ▪
probe the health of nodes.
See the R eplic ation  and Recovery Guide  for more in f ormation.
▪Persistent or sticky  c onnections  are required. Having once connected, a host’s tr a ffic  should be ▪
directed to the same server for considerably longer than the maximum request time.  3-5 minutes is
suitable for most environments.
▪The tr a ffic  must be load balanced as a raw TCP stream. As it is encrypted, the load balancer should ▪
attemp t  no tr anslation  or v alidation  on it.
▪The load balancer’s address facing the Bravura Pass  server must be c on figur ed  in the list of IP ▪
addresses from which Password Manager service will allow requests.
▪A fir e w all  should restrict access to the load balancer so that only those hosts intended to be sources ▪
of transparent s ynchr oniz ation  events may connect to the Password Manager service service. The
CIDR bitmask option  provided in the Password Manager service service c on figur ation  is ine ff ectiv e  if
hosts can connect through a load balancer.
If using load balancers, do not c on figur e  any SSL options  for transparent s ynchr oniz ation  tr a ffic.  SSL
options  should only be c on figur ed  on load balancers for WebUI tr a ffic,  not transparent s ynchr oniz ation.
Transparent s ynchr oniz ation  is encrypted using a proprietary encr yption  algorithm. Contact

This chapter shows you how to set up transparent password s ynchr oniz ation  for a Micr osoft  Windows
server or Activ e  Directory based trigger system.
Before you begin, ensure that you have researched and carried out the steps outlined in Implementing
Transparent Password S ynchr oniz ation  (on page 1659).
About the Password Change Notific ation  Module
Bravura Pass  can intercept password changes on a Windows-based trigger system using the Password
Change Notific ation  Module. The Password Change Notific ation  Module consists of an interceptor
service, intcptsvc , and the psintcpt.dll . The service queues DLL requests and communicates
with the Password Manager service ( idpm ). The DLL captures nativ e  password changes.
The installer package also includes t esting  and maintenance utility  programs.
You can install the Password Change Notific ation  Module on a:
▪ Activ e  Directory domain controller (DC) ▪
This will a ff ect  password changes by users of the Activ e  Directory domain. In order to intercept all
password changes in your domain, you must install the Password Change Notific ation  Module on
every Activ e  Directory DC on your network.
CAUTION: Do not install the Password Change Notific ation  Module on an Activ e
Directory DC that allows blank passwords. If users change their passwords
to a blank password, Activ e  Directory will not send the change to Bravura
Pass , and the event will not be logged.
▪Windows server▪
Password changes local to that server will likewise be subjected to password strength enforcement
and s ynchr oniz ation.
The Password Change Notific ation  Module supports filt er s  that can limit the scope of an Activ e  Directory
DC to a specific  OU mapped to a target system in Bravura Pass . For example, you may want to limit the
passwords that are intercepted to accounts in three OUs on an Activ e  Directory DC. Each OU is mapped
to a separate target system set up in Bravura Pass . The target systems may belong to diff er en t  target
system groups with distinct  password policies. You can install the Password Change Notific ation  Module
on the DC and c on figur e  it with three filt er s  mapped to each OU.
You can also use filt er s  to include or exclude specific  account names to be sent to the Password Manager
service for password strength t esting  and s ynchr oniz ation.
Install the softw ar e
Use intcpt.msi or intcpt-x64.msi from the \<instance>\addon\transparent-synch\ad\
directory to install the Password Change Notific ation  Module.The following ins tructions  show you how to install and c on figur e  the Password Change Notific ation
Module onto a Micr osoft  Activ e  Directory domain controller (DC) and use the softw ar e  module to trigger
the transparent s ynchr oniz ation  process.
Before you begin:
Note the c ommunic ation  key (or Master Key) used to encrypt c ommunic ation  between Bravura Security
components on the network.
The CommKey value is encrypted in Bravura Security Fabric . If you did not record the key in a secure
loc ation,  copy the idmsetup.inf file from <instance> \ p sc on fig \ on the Bravura Security Fabric
server to the same loc ation  as the installer. The installer will extract the Communic ation  Key value from
the file.
This section  shows you how to manually install the Password Change Notific ation  Module using the
Windows Installer.

▪Using MSI installers  (on page 242) for more in f ormation  about setting  MSI pr operties  in a transform ▪
file or from the command line.
Manual ins t allation  steps
To manually install the Password Change Notific ation  Module:
1.Copy the intcpt.msi  or intcpt-x64.msi  installer from the Bravura Pass  server to a scratch 1.
directory (C:\temp) on the server or DC, or to a publicly accessible share.
2.Launch the Windows Installer package.2.Click Next .
3.Read the Bravura Security Fabric  license. Select I accept the terms in the License Agreement if you 3.
agree to the terms and click Next .4.Click Complete to include the Password Change Notific ation  Module and c on figur ation  utility 4.
programs.5.Type the c ommunic ation  key. 5.
Network c ommunic ation  between Bravura Security components is protected using a secret encr yption
key. Enter the same key here as you did on the main Bravura Pass  server (c ommunic ation  key (or
Master Key)). If you copied the idmsetup.inf  file from the Bravura Security Fabric  server the key is
entered aut omatic ally .
Click Next .6. Con figur e  the service by entering the: 6.
▪Bravura Security Fabric server name or IP address▪
▪TCP/IP port the service is listening on▪
▪Primary target system ID this machine corresponds to▪
You must enter the ID of the target system you are installing on as it is c on figur ed  in the Bravura
Pass  primary server.
This target must be c on figur ed  as a Bravura Pass  target system on the primary server before
Password Change Notific ation  Module will function  properly.
▪Long ID format to send to Password Manager service▪
The longid must match the longid on the target system. Choose the format based on the target
system setting  (on page 1668) and how the user’s longid is being listed.
Click Next .
7.Click Install to start the ins t allation. 7.
The installer begins copying files to your computer. The Ins t allation  Complete page appears after  the
softw ar e  has been successfully installed.
8.Click Finish to exit. 8.
9.Click Yes to restart Windows now, or No if you will manually restart later. 9.After  you restart Windows, nativ e  password changes will be intercepted by the Password Change
Notific ation  Module and forwarded to the Bravura Pass  server for transparent s ynchr oniz ation.
Configur e  the Password Manager service
1.Log into the Bravura Pass  server as a superuser. 1.
2.Navigate to Manage the system > Maintenance > Services . Select the Password Manager Service . 2.
3.Enter the IP address of the AD server with the appropriate mask into Comma-delimited list of IP 3.
addresses with CIDR bitmask that are allowed to send socket requests . For instance, if the AD server
IP is 10.0.23.76 and it is the only server to contact then the entry would be 10.0.23.76/32.
4.Click Update . 4.
5.Stop and start the Password manager service (idpm ). 5.
a.At the bottom  of the page, locate the Service status section. a.
b.Select Stop the service . b.
6.Start the idpm  service by selecting  Start the service . 6.
T r oubleshooting
If the password change fails to propagate, double check the following:
▪Ensure that the instance and AD server fir e w alls  have the correct settings.  Incorrect fir e w all  settings ▪
will block the change password request from reaching the instance server and the password change
will not be propagated.
▪The domain controller has been added to list of IP addresses allowed to send socket requests to the▪
IDPM Password Manager Service. Once again, the password change request will not be propagated
with the wrong IP address.
▪There might be a mismatch on the longid format. As stated before, it must match the longid on the▪
target system.
Setting  the longid format
The longid format on the target system must match the longid format used by the Password Change
Notific ation  Module. By default, the agtaddn connector’s longid format is set to the NT4 name format.
Complete one or more of the following:
1.Select the matching longid format during the ins t allation  of the Password Change Notific ation  Module, 1.
(on page 1662)
Note: Versions of the Password Change Notific ation  Module older than 11.0.1
do not prompt for a longid format and instead, set the longid to the
distinguished  name (DN) format by default
or
2.Change the longid format on the target system to use the distinguished  name (DN) format. See the 2.
Connector Pack documen t ation  for Windows target systems.
or3.Modify the intcptsvc.cfg c on figur ation  file, located in: 3.
<Program Files path>\Bravura Security\Password Filter\service\
a.Locate the following lines:a.
  # LongID = "%sAMAccountName%"; 
  # LongID = "DomainName\\%sAMAccountName%"; 
  LongID = "%distinguishedName%";
b.Comment out the LongID line:b.
  LongID = "%distinguishedName%"
c.Locate and uncomment the following line:c.
 # LongID = "DomainName\\%sAMAccountName%"
d.Specify the DomainName of the target.d.
e.Save the c on figur ation  file. e.
f.Restart the intcptsvc service. f.
T esting  the c onnection
Test c onnectivity  and initializ e  the API by running the diagutil program.
Use the diagutil program for tr oubleshooting  the Bravura Security Password Change Notific ation
Module interceptor. Once executed, it submits real requests to the Password Manager service ( idpm ) to
process according to the password interceptor service ( intcptsvc ) c on figur ation  file.
This program acts as a real time  logging utility  to monitor the activities  between the interceptor and the
Password Manager service ( idpm ) on the Bravura Security Fabric  server; for example, if an account
password is changed, using net user <accountName> <Password>  in another command prompt,
the activities  are displayed in the diagutil prompt until  [Ctrl]+[C] is used to stop logging.
This program is installed by intcpt.msi  or intcpt-64.msi  on a Windows transparent password
s ynchr oniz ation  trigger system and can be found in the following directory:
<Program Files path>\Bravura Security\Password Filt er\util\
