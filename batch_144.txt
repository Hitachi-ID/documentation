Modifying how oper ations  are viewed
You can use the workflo w  view modific ation  plugin to modify which oper ations  are visible to viewers of
w orkflo w  requests in Bravura Security Fabric . This is useful in cases where access changes such as
account cr eation,  additions  to groups, or role changes are known only at an abstract level. This plugin can
be used where:
▪Viewing oper ation  details may be excessive or confusing ▪
▪Details should be accessible but a summary would be more appropriate▪
▪Some details are irrelevant to an authorizer who is authorizing a single group addition ▪
▪It may be inappropriate for an authorizer of one oper ation  to see what else is being requested ▪
This is an alt ernativ e  to mapping several oper ations  to a single request using the oper ation  rewrite
plugin. The following use cases demonstrate how the oper ations  view modific ation  plugin might be used:
 
Use case 1: Showing authorizers only what they are authorizing 
Normally, authorizers can see all oper ations  that are part of a request, including those that they are not
required to authorize. This may be confusing for an authorizer who only needs to authorize part of a
request, and may even lead them to mistakenly deny the request.
The w orkflo w  view modific ation  plugin can run to only display oper ations  for which the viewer is the
authorizer.
Use case 2: Abstract modific ations  
The requester wants to remove a user’s “floor  fir e marshal” role. This entails the user being removed
from a dis tribution  list, and from three groups, and r es tricting  their access within the building’s security
system.
End users – the requester, recipient and the assigned authorizers – do not understand the list, the
groups, or the security system. All they understand or care about is that the user is no longer the floor
fir e marshal.
The requester changes some attribut es  on the user’s pr ofile  page and submits the request.
Bravura Security Fabric  runs the request rewrite plugin to “fan out” the request to include oper ations
a ff ecting  the list, the groups and the security system (using an implementer target). It also includes a
psuedo oper ation  to “update the user” to remove her from the floor  fir e marshal role.
The w orkflo w  view modific ation  plugin rewrites what the users see so that the request only contains the
removal from the role. The plugin can make the real oper ation  details available if the user clicks a Details
button  where a summary of the request is listed.
The plugin is run by the Requests  app whenever a request is viewed on the request details pages.To use this plugin, type the name of the plugin in the IDSYNCH WORKFLOW MOD VIEW PLUGIN  field  on
the W orkflo w  > Options  > Plugins c on figur ation  page.
There are no shipped plugins in use with this plugin point. A sample, plugin-wf-modview.psl , is
available in the samples\ directory. See more for in f ormation  on writing  a custom plugin program
Requirements
See W riting  plugins  for general requirements.
Ex ecution  points
The plugin is run by the W orkflo w  Manager Service.
Input
Input to the plugin includes:
"" "" = {
  "module" = "<module>"
  "recipient" "user" = { } #Recipient's data if they are an
                         # existing user
  "request" "" = { #Standard request data listing resources
    "resource" "" = {}
      }
  "detailResource" = "<itemID>" #If this is present,
                   # the user has just clicked the 'Details' button
                   # next to the resource with the itemID.
                   # The plugin should return only resources
                   # that are considered details of that resource.
  "requester" "user" = {} #Requester's data
  "viewer" "user" = {} #Viewer's data
                       # -- requester, recipient, or authorizer
   }
The "resource" KVGroup includes an "enact" key that is used to indicate which resources are a ff ect ed
during the request. This can be used to hide resources that are not a ff ect ed  during the request. For
example, if the resource "enact" key is set to false, then the action  on the resource is not executed, so it
could be hidden.
Output
The oper ation  view modific ation  plugin returns the following output:
"" "" = {
 "errmsg" = ""    # error message, if any
 "retval" = "<N>"   # 0 is success, anything else is failure "changed" = "(true|false)"  # If this is included and set to false, it
                             # will be assumed that all items will be
                             # visible.
  "resource" "" = {
                   #Followed by any number of resource entries
          "display" = "(true|
false)" # If this is present and set to false,
                             # hide the resource.  If the item is not in
                             # the output, it will be displayed.
          "detailsAvailable" = "(true|
false)" # If this is present and set to
                             # true, display a button to allow details to
                             # be viewed for this resource. The plugin
                             # determines what resources are considered to
                             # be details of this resource.
    }
  }
.
Using pseudo oper ations
In some or g aniz ations  the cr eation  of accounts, additions  to groups, or role changes are known to users
only at an abstract level. Showing what modific ations  are going to be done is:
▪ P ot entially  excessive ▪
▪ P ot entially  time-c onsuming  to have the authorizer sift through the in f ormation  to determine what is ▪
“really” being requested
▪Confusing for end users who “just want to do what sales people do”▪
Bravura Security Fabric  allows you to display pseudo operations  that describe what is being done at an
abstract level as part of a request. The oper ations  can be searched on and audited, but nothing is actually
done by any connector. Pseudo oper ations  simply allow end users to understand what is being requested
even if they do not understand the details.
They can be standard oper ations  that contain pseudo data; for example to add a user to a group that
doesn’t actually exist on a target system. They can also be completely customized oper ations;  for
example, users can request to “update a user” to make them the new “floor  fir e marshal”.
The request rewrite plugin  (on page 1418) must be used to generate output for a pseudo oper ation.  That
in f ormation  can then be used to display details of the request to users, and as input for the w orkflo w
view modific ation  plugin . The Abstract modific ations  use case in Modifying how oper ations  are viewed
(on page 1431) illustrates how pseudo oper ations  are used.
See more detailed in f ormation  about how plugins handle pseudo oper ations
InputPlugins receive in f ormation  about pseudo oper ations  in three key-value pairs within the main "request"
KVGroup:
"request" "" = {
     ...
  "resource" "<resource identifier>" = {
    "authorizationsReceived" = "<number of authorizations received>"
    "authorizationsRequired" = "<number of authorizations required>"
    "authorizer" = "<authorizers for this resource>" ⋆
    "notes" = ""  # empty - only filled in upon provisioning
    "operation" = "<operation code>"
    "pseudoData" = "<Data for replacement in pseudoTag>"
    "pseudoOp" = "true|false" #Is this a pseudo Operation?
         # If true, this operation is NOT handled by idtm
    "pseudoTag" = "<m4 tag for display in the GUI>"
    "result" = "<status of the resource>"
    "itemType" = "<item type>"
    ...
    }
 }
See Request data  (on page 1506) for a listing  of the full request KVGroup.
Data about pseudo oper ations  is included in the reqacct table along with other oper ations  data. Any
normally requested oper ation,  such as create and update, can be passed in as a pseudo oper ation.  For
example:
    "operation" = "GRUA" #add the user to a group
    "pseudoData" = ""
    "pseudoOp" = "true" #The group does not exist on a target system.
    "pseudoTag" = ""
Custom oper ations
You can also use custom oper ation  tags CUST1, CUST2, CUST3 for requests that are not standard to
Bravura Security Fabric . For example:
    "operation" = "CUST1" #Update the user
    "pseudoData" = "Fire marshal"
    "pseudoOp" = "true" #
    "pseudoTag" = ""
You can customize the description  for these oper ations  in M4 files,  so that they can be displayed and
searched on as request types in the Bravura Security Fabric  user interface.These operations  diff er  from the OPC1, OPC2, OPC3, and OPC4 operations,  which can be used to trigger
events resulting  from input to custom fields  in the user interface  (on page 3505).
To use pseudo data with standard oper ations,  customize:
▪!!!JOB_SEARCH in batchmod.m4  to allow it to be specified ▪
▪The _BATCHMOD_PSEUDO_DATA_ tag in en-us-language.kvg ▪
▪The BATCHMOD_PSEUDO_DATA tag in en-us-errmsg.kvg ▪

There may be 0 or more resource KVGroups. The resources returned will replace the ones in the request.
If you do not want to modify the request, all resources passed into the plugin must be returned as
output.
The format and contents of the resource KVGroup should be the same as the input would be if the
resource was part of a normal request. It is recommended that you issue a request for the resource
requested to gather the input format for that specific  oper ation.

General w orkflo w  options
Option Description
ENABLE DELETE OTHER OWNER Activ e  Directory network resource owners are allowed to delete other
group owners.
HIDE PLUGIN ERRMSG FROM USERS Hide detailed plugin error messages from end users. When enabled, end
uses only see "Plugin failed". When disabled (default) plugin error messages
include the path to the plugin, and if possible, the script line number and
error message.
IDACCESS GROUPS THRESHOLD If the number of groups with access to a network resource is greater than
or equal to this threshold, consider the resource pr oblematic.  This value is
used by the IDACCESS TOO MANY GROUPS event option.
For example, too many groups with access to a resource may indicate an
infrastructure management issue. The interface program set by IDACCESS
TOO MANY GROUPS can check to see if the pr oblematic  resource has been
reviewed before, and if not, send in f ormation  about the resource to the
system administrator.Option Description
IDP APPROVE SINGLE RESOURCE If enabled, authorizers can approve or deny requested resources
individually.
See Act on individual entitlemen ts  in the end user documen t ation  for more.
Note: This is setting  is temporarily disabled if the request is for a group set
or account set access. This is to prevent users from gaining access to denied
requests of this type if a single resource is approved.
IDP REQUIRES REASON
APPROVALAuthorizers are required to enter a reason when they approve a request.
IDP REQUIRES REASON
REJECTIONAuthorizers are required to enter a reason when they deny a request.
IDSYNCH FULL NAME FORMAT How the full name of a user displays in email and Bravura Security Fabric
web pages.
IDV REQUIRES REASON
COMPLETEDImplementers must enter a reason for marking a task as completed.
IDV REQUIRES REASON COULD
NOT COMPLETEImplementers must enter a reason for being unable to complete a task.
IDWFM AUTH PHASE PROPAGATION If an authorizer is c on figur ed  to be in more than one phase, allow the
authorizer’s response in the fir s t phase to be propagated to later phases.
IDWFM AUTO APPROVE Allow requests where the requester is also the authorizer to be
aut omatic ally  approved.
IDWFM AUTO REJECT TIME Number of days before a request is aut omatic ally  denied if it is not
processed. This field  ignores the REQUIRES REASON DELETION option  if it is
set.
IDWFM CURRENT EVENT CACHE
TIMECache events in the W orkflo w  Manager Service that are younger than this
many hours. Default is 12.
The larger the number, the more memory spaces are allocated to the
W orkflo w  Manager Service for cache; however, if this number is too big, it
may break Windows memory management, causing unexpected results.
IDWFM DAYS COUNT WEEKDAY
ONLYIf enabled, the W orkflo w  Manager Service auto reject time  and esc alation
time  only includes weekdays.
MAX AUTH ALLOWED The maximum number of authorizers or implementers that the w orkflo w
service can assign to each resource in a request. When the number of
authorizers or implementers exceeds this value, the request is put on hold.
The value can be from 0 to 200. The default is 20.
MAX UPLOAD FILE SIZE The maximum file size allowed for uploaded pr ofile  and request attribut es.
The default is 1000KB.
REQUIRES REASON DELETION Requesters and recipients are required to enter a reason when they delete
a change request when using the Requests.
WF ATTRVAL PLUGIN RUN IDR
SUMMARYWhen enabled, the attribut e  v alidation  plugin will execute on the request
summary page. This will allow any additional  attribut es  to be added to the
request prior to submission. By default, this option  is disabled.Option Description
WF CLEAN RESERVEOBJ When a request is initia t ed,  and before it is posted, Bravura Security Fabric
reserves IDs to ensure that they are unique. By default, Bravura Security
Fabric  cleans up a request’s reserved objects when a request fails to post or
goes into “On hold pending administrator in t er v ention”  status.This allow
r eser v ations  to be made again if a previous request attemp t ed  to make the
r eser v ation  and failed.
Turn this off if you want clean up of reserved IDs to be handled in another
way, for example, by calling API processes, to avoid situations  where valid
r eser v ations  are deleted.
WF HIDE AUTHORIZERS When enabled, the list of authorizers assigned to a request is hidden on the
request details page. By default, this option  is enabled. Authorizers can
choose to see who else may be reviewing a request by selecting  the
Authorizers checkbox. When disabled, the authorizers list is always shown.
WF HIDE OTHER OPERATIONS When enabled, authorizers only see oper ations  they are assigned to when
reviewing a request. By default, this option  is enabled. Authorizers can
change this view by selecting  a Show all—Show mine toggle, or by selecting
an All oper ations  checkbox on the request details page. When disabled, all
oper ations  that are part of a request are always shown.
WF ONLY PROP ATTRS ON UPDATE When enabled, pr ofile  and request attribut e  changes are only propagated
to target system attribut es  during pr ofile  update requests. By default, this
option  is disabled. When disabled, all updates to attribut es  are propagated
to a ff ect ed  target systems, regardless of the oper ation  being performed.
WF ONLY SHOW EXPECTED
OPERATIONSWhen a request is viewed and a resource is not enacted the default view
will to show all oper ations  expected. When this is set to enabled the
request will show only the oper ations  that will occur. Users can change this
view on the request page with a Show all and Hide button.
WF PHASED AUTH Enable this option  to allow phased authoriz ation  of resources and policies.
To disable this option,  you must fir s t delete all phases from resources and
policies.
WF RESERVE ON PRIMARY Enable this option  to send reserve requests to the primary instance when
the requests are made from a r eplic ation  node.
WF RESOURCE RELATEDONLY Enable this option  to include only resources assigned to the recipient in
authorizer notific ation  emails
WF WAIT AUTHORIZER
CALCULATIONEnable this option  to get Bravura Security Fabric  to wait while authoriz ation
requirements are being calculated before returning to CGI pages where
requests are issued.
This may be useful in cases where users who are auto-approved may be
confused when the request status is temporarily shown as w aiting  for
authoriz ation.
WF ROLE USERADDDEL IGNORE
DEPSWhen this option  is enabled, role membership will be added or deleted
even if some dependent oper ations  fail.
