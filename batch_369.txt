The idmsuite.log  file includes codes from connectors (agents) as they attemp t  to contact targets and
communicate with them. You can use them to troubleshoot issues that may occur during auto discovery
or with connector oper ations  triggered by services like idpm , idwfm , idarch . The email that process
sends to product administrators, or the error logged contains only the numeric return code value for a
connector (in the output KVGroup of the connector as well as in idmsuite.log .
Integer values returned by connectors indicate the success or failure of an oper ation:
ACSuccess 0 - The oper ation  succeeded
ACUnknownError 1 - The oper ation  failed with an unspecified  error

OpenSSL library
This product includes softw ar e  developed by the OpenSSL Project ( http://w w w .openssl.or g / ).
The OpenSSL Project is a c ollabor ativ e  e ff ort  to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured, and
Open Source toolkit implementing  the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS
v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library.
OpenSSL is based on the excellent SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young and Tim J. Hudson. The
OpenSSL toolkit is under a dual license - both the c onditions  of the OpenSSL License and the original
SSLeay license apply to the toolkit. See below for the actual license texts.
