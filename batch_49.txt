The Connector Pack Documen t ation  contains specific  t ar g eting  and in t egr ation  in f ormation  on a per
system basis. It also contains in f ormation  about the diff er en t  connectors and the oper ations  that they
support.
Planning target systems
Use the following questions  to help you determine your target system c on figur ation:
1.How should Bravura Security Fabric  determine user pr ofile  IDs? 1.
Select a system or set of systems to designate as your pr ofile  ID source. This system or set of systems
should contain a login ID for all (or most) of the Bravura Security Fabric  users in your or g aniz ation.  If
possible, designate a system that uses the most common or standardized naming c on v ention.
You can c on figur e  Bravura Security Fabric  to list email addresses from some systems (Activ e
Directory), and they can be used to generate pr ofile  IDs. Alt ernativ ely ,  you can c on figur e  Bravura
Security Fabric  to interface with an e xisting  user pr ofile  database or meta directory, instead of listing
login IDs or email addresses from a target system.
2.Are login IDs standardized in your or g aniz ation? 2.
Does user John Smith log in with JOHNS on all of his systems? And, is the login ID JOHNS used only
by John Smith on all systems?If some or all of your target systems use standard IDs, you can c on figur e  Bravura Security Fabric  to
aut omatic ally  associate accounts on these systems with a pr ofile  ID.
You must also decide if you want users to be able to attach  login IDs that are associated with another
user’s pr ofile,  if they know the correct password.
If any of your target systems do not use standard IDs:
▪Users must be able to attach  non-associated IDs using the Attach  other accounts  (PSL) module. ▪
or
▪help desk user s must be able to assign or unassign IDs using the Help users  (IDA) module. ▪
or
▪You must map login IDs to pr ofile  IDs in a text file. ▪
3.Are login IDs on your target system c ase-sensitiv e? 3.
Does your system diff er entia t e  between the login ID neild and NeilD ? You must c on figur e
Bravura Security Fabric  to match the behavior of your system.
4.Should Bravura Security Fabric  discover accounts on your target system aut omatic ally? 4.
Most of the Bravura Security Fabric  connectors support auto discovery. They are able to connect to
target systems and collect an inventory of login IDs. Auto discovery is normally performed nightly. It is
highly recommended that you enable auto discovery in order to keep the in f ormation  in the Bravura
Security Fabric  database current.
If auto discovery is not supported on your system or if for some reason you will not c on figur e  Bravura
Security Fabric  to aut omatic ally  discover accounts, you must manually provide an inventory of login
IDs. This is normally done using a batch process on the target system.
5.Should users be able to change or verify passwords on your target system using Bravura Security 5.
Fabric  ?
When adding a new target system, the change password and verify password c apabilities  are enabled
by default. You can disable one or both of these c apabilities  if:
▪The functionality  is not supported on your particular  target system; for example, password ▪
v erific ations  are possible, but adminis tr ativ e  resets are not.
▪You do not want users to have access to the capability; for example, the system is not a trusted ▪
system nor an authorit ative  system and therefore password v erific ations  should not be allowed.
If password changes are enabled, you must determine if the target should be displayed on the help
desk Change passwords screen or the self-service Change passwords screen. You must also
determine if the target should be added to the authentic ation  priority list .
You may also want to set an connector e x ecution  sequence to improve performance.
6.Do targets need to be grouped to apply diff ering  password policies, s ynchr oniz ation  rules, or help 6.
desk access rights?
Bravura Pass  can apply global password strength rules, and synchronize a user’s password across all
targets. You may want to set up target system groups; for example, if subsets of targets have
inc ompatible  password strength rules, or if you want a user’s passwords to vary on two or more
targets. You may also want to group targets if you want to restrict access rights of groups of help desk
users.7.Does your target system incorporate a password expiry policy?7.
Bravura Security Fabric  supports listing  users with soon-to-expire passwords from several target
systems (Activ e  Directory, Micr osoft  Windows NT). If your target system incorporates a password
expiry policy, and if listing  soon-to-expire users is supported on that system, you should determine
whether or not you are going to implement expiry notific ation .
If your target system does not have a nativ e  password expiry policy, you should determine whether or
not Bravura Security Fabric  is going to track password history and force users to change their
passwords. You can c on figur e  Bravura Security Fabric  to force users to change their passwords by
modifying the Bravura Security Fabric  password pollicy.
8.Is your target system composed of multiple  servers? 8.
Some target systems are actually composed of multiple  servers. These include:
▪ Multiple  Activ e  Directory domain controllers that comprise one domain or more (a forest) ▪
▪An NIS master server and multiple  NIS secondary servers that make up an NIS domain ▪
▪ Oper ating  system, DBMS, and applic ation  target systems that function  as a single logical applic ation ▪
system
Bravura Pass  supports these systems using the concept of a sub-host . A sub-host is one of multiple
target systems on which Bravura Pass  can manage passwords that together form a single larger
target system. See Target systems composed of multiple  servers  (on page 503)for details.
9.Do other users have adminis tr ativ e  access to the target systems? Are there other unmanaged 9.
means of access?
Each administrated target system should be assessed for prior access, to ensure that any previous
adminis tr ativ e  access has been restricted before cr eating  target systems and managed system s:
▪Examine any non-standard adminis tr ativ e  accounts previously created. For example: Activ e ▪
Directory, Windows NT, Unix, SQL Server, Oracle.
▪Restrict adminis tr ativ e  group access. For example, Activ e  Directory, Unix. ▪
▪Remove or revoke Unix SSH authorized remote access.▪
▪Remove sudo access to Unix/Linux accounts.▪
This is a list of examples; it is not a complete list.

Getting  started
 Requirements 
Before you add a target system to Bravura Security Fabric  :
1.Plan ahead. For example, determine the purpose of the target system: Is it a source of pr ofile  IDs? Is it 1.
a trusted system that can be used to authentic a t e  users? What resources should Bravura Security
Fabric  manage on the target system?
2. Con figur e  the actual target system as described in the Connector Pack Documen t ation . 2.
Depending on the type of system, this may be as simple as cr eating  a target system administrator
account on the target system. Some systems require that you install client softw ar e  on the Bravura
Security Fabric  server and/or that you perform more c on figur ation  on the target system itself to allow
Bravura Security Fabric  to perform the required oper ations  using the administrator accounts you
provided. Other systems require that you write a script to de fine  oper ations.  Ensure that you read and
follow all steps described in the ”Pr epar ation”  section  of each target system chapter in Connector
Pack Documen t ation .
3.Determine the settings  that you must c on figur e  when you add the target system to Bravura Security 3.
Fabric .
The “ T ar g eting ”  section  of each target system chapter in the Connector Pack Documen t ation  describes
the required or recommended settings.  Con figuring  general options  (on page 494) in this document
describes all available options.
