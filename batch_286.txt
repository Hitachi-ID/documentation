Set up the Bravura Security  API SOAP service
This step specific ally  assist with the IIS binding that is needed for the service to run. For more detailed
in f ormation  about the API SOAP Service, see API SOAP Service  (on page 2847).
1.Log in to your instance as a superuser.1.
2.Click Manage the system > Maintenance > Service. 2.3.Click the Bravura Security  (idapisoap) API SOAP Service. 3.
4.In the Endpoints for the IDAPI SOAP nativ e  service  field  enter the appropriate comma separated 4.
values. For example, http://localhost/<Your Instance>/idapi . In the case of a fully
qualified  domain, ensure that you add in a similar fashion for both http and http s.
5.Click Update . 5.
6.Stop and start the service so that these settings  will be recognized by the service. This is a 6.
requirement to update this setting.  This will also have to be done any time  the settings  change.
If you have multiple  nodes, repeat these steps to set the endpoints on all nodes. This is not a setting
that will aut omatic ally  propagate through the s ynchroniz ation  process.

The Logging Service ( idmlogsvc ) manages logging sessions for a particular  instance. It captures event
messages from Bravura Security Fabric program e x ecution,  and writes them to the c on figur ed  log file
(idmsuite.log by default).
The Logging Service also has the ability to write to the Windows event logs.
Configur ation
The service is aut omatic ally  installed and started on the Bravura Security Fabric  server during setup. You
can modify the following parameters related to this service on the Service in f ormation  page:
Note: You can update the idmlogsvc parameters without having to restart
the Logging Service; however, the service’s event tracing needs to be
restarted for the c on figur ation  changes to take e ff ect.
If the Bravura Security Fabric  server runs out of disk space, the Logging Service stops logging until  there is
at least 10 MB of disk space available, then it begins logging again.
idmlogsvc service options
Option Description
Name of the log file The name of the Bravura Security Fabric log file. The default is
idmsuite.log .
The file is created in the directory de fined  by the PSTempDir
setting.  This is normally <Program Files path>
\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric
\Logs\<instance> . When the service starts, Bravura
Security Fabric creates the directory if it does not already
exist.
Default level for log messages The default logging level. It can be set to:
▪No debugging▪
▪Default debugging▪
▪Full debugging▪
Enabled extended log levels The default extended level. It can be set to none, one or both
of:
▪ Runtime  performance messages – All binary and script ▪
performance are recorded.
▪Ajax runtime  performance messages – All Ajax requests, ▪
including the function  name, transid, dur ation,  and user
are recorded.
▪Stored procedure runtime  performance messages – The ▪
performance of stored procedures, called by binaries, is
recorded.
▪Local w ork s t ation  service runtime  performance messages ▪
Command-line options  for idmlogsvc are listed below:idmlogsvc service command-line options

-c on fig  -bufsize <N> Set the size of the session buff er s.
-c on fig  -bufmax<N> Set the maximum number of buff er s.
Log directory r ot ation
You can use the following command from the service directory to rotate the Logs directory de fined  by the
PSTempDir setting:
idmlogsvc -rotatelog [<N>] 
This command performs a backup and r ot ation  of the Logs directory. That is, it appends . <yyyy> -<mm> -
<dd> -<hhmmss> .<SerialNo> to the old directory name and creates a new directory with the original
name, up to a maximum of <N> copies (default is 7).
If the directory path set in PsTempDir ends with the instance name, the entir e  log folder will be rotated,
cr eating  new folders named after  the instance. Otherwise, all files and folders contained inside
PsTempDir will be (non-recursively) rotated, using their original names.
To perform a one time  manual r ot ation  of the log file directory, type:idmlogsvc.exe -rotatelog 
By default, the r ot ation  method is set to using the last modified  date of the f older/file.  You can modify
the r ot ation  method by adding the following registry entry in:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\<instance>\idmlogsvc
Entryname RotateType
Value 0—1 Set to 1 to rotate using the date and time
contained in the f older/file  name.
Datatype DWORD
Default 0
Logs directory r ot ation  is scheduled to occur nightly  (on page 2702) on the Bravura Security Fabric  server.
Logs on proxy servers are rotated if auto discovery  is executed between +/-0.5 hours of the scheduled job.
See About the Bravura Security Fabric Log  (on page 2776) for more in f ormation  about log files.
Event tracing
To stop and start event tracing from the command line, so that c on figur ation  parameters can be changed,
type the following:
idmlogsvc.exe -trace-stop
Once you have finished  modifying c on figur ation  parameters, type:
idmlogsvc.exe -trace-start
Alt ernativ ely ,  you can make the c on figur ation  changes and then restart event tracing by typing:
idmlogsvc.exe -trace-restart
Logging to a syslog service
You can enable the Logging Service to log to a syslog service on a remote system in addition  to the
e xisting  local text files.
The service uses a c on figur ation  file, idmlogsvc.cfg , located in the \<instance>\service\
directory. This file is aut omatic ally  generated when you install Bravura Security Fabric. To set syslog
logging, you must edit idmlogsvc.cfg  to contain the address of the syslog service.
To do this, on the Bravura Security Fabric server:
1.Stop the Logging Service.1.
2.Create a backup copy of idmlogsvc.cfg . 2.
3.Open i dmlogsvc.cfg  using a text editor. 3.
a.To enable the syslog delivery feature change the following:a.
!SyslogCollectors = {
to
SyslogCollectors = {b.Set the syslog collector host, file loc ation  or debug output pr e fix: b.
"UDP=10.0.59.189" "514" = {
or
"TCP=10.0.59.189" "514" = {
or
"FILE=C:\\Windows\\Temp\\idmlogsvc_syslog.txt" "" = {
or
"DEBUG=::IDMLOG::" "" = {
c.Set the preferred format of the logs. By default the log is set to syslog format.c.
d.Set the preferred end-of-line style. By default the log end-of-line style is set to none.d.
e. De fine  the delivery c onditions  by changing the Matches KVGroup to include or exclude certain log e.
messages. Examples are provided in the c on figur ation  file, idmlogsvc.cfg .
4.Save the file. 4.
5.Restart the Logging Service.5.
When upgrading Bravura Security Fabric, the idmlogsvc.cfg c on figur ation  file will be retained from the
previous version. A new c on figur ation  file named idmlogsvc.bak will be created and will contain the
c on figur ation  settings  of idmlogsvc.cfg  for Bravura Security Fabric 12.6.
This c on figur ation  file should be reviewed for any changes between idmlogsvc.cfg  (c on figur ation
settings  from the previous version) and idmlogsvc.bak  (c on figur ation  settings  for Bravura Security
Fabric 12.6) after  the upgrade is complete.
Excluding types of data
You can exclude certain types of data from idmsuite.log by editing  idmlogsvc.cfg to include an
ExcludeFromMainLog KVGroup.
To do this, on the Bravura Security Fabric server:
1.Stop the Logging Service.1.
2.Create a backup copy of idmlogsvc.cfg . 2.
3.Open idmlogsvc.cfg  using a text editor. 3.
4.Add an ExcludedFromMainLog  KVGroup with the following syntax: 4.
ExcludedFromMainLog = {
<module name>[compare operator] = <log level name>;
...
};
Compare operators are:
: equal the level (omitted)
> equal or higher than the level< equal or lower than the level
! not the level
You can use * as a wild card for both the module name and log level. For example:
ExcludedFromMainLog = {
*: = per_lsw;
updinst.exe>=info;
psupdate.exe< = info;
iddb.exe! = verbose;
mobworker.exe = ⋆;
};
Combining repeated log messages
The Logging Service reduces the amount of times  a particular  log message is displayed when logged
c onsecutiv ely .  For example, if multiple  instances of a particular  log message occurs in a given interval, the
message will be only be displayed once, and will be followed by a log message s t ating  the number of
times  the last message was repeated.
For example:
2014-04-03 12:26:23.286.5320 - [] test_plugin [60,64] Info: W aiting  for
response
2014-04-03 12:26:33.288.6614 - [] test_plugin [60,64] last message repeated 4 times
The default interval that the log messages will be combined is 60 seconds. After  this interval, the next
instance of the log message will be displayed again, and any other instances of the message that follow
will be combined accordingly.
You can modify the repeated timeout  value by adding the following registry entry in:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\<instance>\idmlogsvc
Entry name f or ce- flush-r epea t ed-timeout
Value the time  in seconds to combine repeated log messages.
Data type DWORD
Default 60
Mobile Worker Service (mobworker)
The Mobile Worker Service ( mobworker ) works in c onjunction  with the Bravura One  proxy server to
allow the Bravura One  app on mobile devices to access Bravura Security Fabric  servers.The Mobile Worker Service works with the Bravura One  proxy server and Mobile Proxy Service
(mobproxy ) to allow a Bravura One  app on mobile devices to access Bravura Security Fabric  servers on
a corporate private network from a home or public WiFi hot spot or a cell phone data plan.
The Mobile Worker Service uses the following components to communicate with the Bravura One  proxy
server:
▪Bravura One  mobile proxy server authentic ation  encr yption  key. ▪
▪Host name or IP address of the Bravura One  mobile proxy server. ▪
▪Bravura One  proxy push notific ation  server authentic ation  encr yption  key. ▪
▪Host name or IP address of the Bravura One  proxy push notific ation  server. ▪
▪Whether or not the Bravura Security Fabric  server uses HTTPS encr yption. ▪
Configur ation
The service is aut omatic ally  installed on the Bravura Security Fabric  server, but not enabled or started,
during setup. You can modify the following parameters related to this service on the Service in f ormation
page:
mobworker service options
Option Description
Proxy authentic ation  key Set the authentic ation  key to be the same value as the authentic ation
encr yption  key that is c on figur ed  on the Bravura One  proxy server.
Proxy server URL Set this to the URL of the Bravura One  proxy server that the Bravura One  app
will be using for c ommunic ation  with the Bravura Security Fabric  server. For
example:
http s://mobpr o xy .br a vur asecurity .c om/y our_c ompan y/<ins t ance>
If a load balancer is being used for the Bravura One  proxy servers, the load
balancer url must be specified  using this parameter. This is also the public url
in which the Bravura One  app will communicate with and to locate a Bravura
One proxy server as designated by the load balancer.
See Mobile access  (on page 1444) for more in f ormation  about load balancing
the Bravura One  proxy servers.Option Description
Private proxy server URL for this
instanceSet this to the URL of the Bravura One  proxy server that will be used for the
persistent c onnection  for c ommunic ation  with this instance for when a load
balancer environment is c on figur ed  for the proxy servers.
This parameter is not required if a load balanced url has not been c on figur ed
for Proxy server URL.
It must however be specified  for the private proxy server url that this instance
will have a dedicated / persistent c onnection  with when a load balanced
environment is used.
In load balanced environments for the Bravura One  proxy servers, this value
may be a single value for a specific  proxy server or it may be set to multiple
Bravura One  proxy servers in a comma-separated list. Setting  it to multiple
proxy servers is to allow for failover in case a Bravura One  proxy server is
taken offline  or is unavailable. The next proxy server as designated by the load
balancer and is in this list will be used for the c onnections  to ensure that the
Bravura One  app may c ontinue  to be used uninterrupted. Each Bravura One
proxy server used as a failover must in the comma-separated list for Private
proxy server URL for this instance.
When the Bravura Security Fabric server is set up for database r eplic ation,  the
value for Private proxy server URL for this instance across the instance nodes
may also be either set to the same Bravura One  proxy server to share the
same Bravura One  proxy server URL or they may each be set for their own
proxy server.
In all cases, the instance name as de fined  in each of the urls for the Private
proxy server URL for this instance must be the same as the instance name as
c on figur ed  for the Bravura Security Fabric  server.
URL of the local instance Set this using the fully qualified  URL of the Bravura Security Fabric  server that
the Mobile Worker Service is currently running on. This must be set on each
of the replicated nodes when database r eplic ation  has been c on figur ed.
Set this using the following format: https://fqdn_or_ip_address/
instance_name
If left blank, the server name specified  by BASE_IDSYNCH_URL is used.
HTTP proxy to use for internal
c onnectionsSet this if a corporate proxy server is used for internal c onnections.  Specify
the proxy server with the address:port format. Set the value to ":" to use the
system proxy settings.  This format must be used to support a proxy bypass
list.
Timeout in seconds for accessing
the local instanceThe number of seconds for the timeout  for the Bravura One  app when
accessing the Bravura Security Fabric instance.
Default value is 300.
Push notific ation  server
authentic ation  keySet the authentic ation  encr yption  key that is c on figur ed  for the Bravura One
proxy push notific ation  server.
Push notific ation  server URL Set this to the URL of the Bravura One  proxy push notific ation  server that is
used for c ommunic ation  with the Bravura Security Fabric server and to send
push notific ations  to a user’s mobile device for users that have a registered
Bravura One  app.
