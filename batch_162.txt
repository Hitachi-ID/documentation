Login Assistant: Setting  up on a domain
You can set up a domain-level SKA if you do not want to install softw ar e  on users’ w ork s t ations.
A domain-level secure kiosk account is a network login account de fined  in an Activ e  Directory domain. It
typically has a help login ID. A security policy is applied to the help account that restricts access to the
oper ating  system and network resources when using the SKA.
1.Create the help user  (on page 1611) . 1.
2. Con figur e  the runurl program  (on page 1611). 2.
3.Create a policy  (on page 1616) to lock down Windows w ork s t ations. 3.
4.Remove the help account from the Bravura Security Fabric  account list, to prevent users from 4.
changing the help account password or attaching  the ID.
5. Adv ertise  the help account  (on page 1622) to Bravura Security Fabric  users. 5.
These steps are explained in detail in the following sections.
Unless otherwise stated, all steps are performed on an Active  Directory DC (domain controller), and must
be performed using administrator credentials.  Details vary depending on your version of Windows.
Create a help user
To create a help user to serve as an SKA:
1.Open Activ e  Directory Users and Computers . 1.
2.Create a new user with the User logon name  help and a hard-to-guess password that complies with 2.
your password complexity rules. Ensure that you:
a.Select the following checkboxes:a.
▪User cannot change password▪
▪Password never expires▪
b.Deselect the following boxes:b.
▪User must change password at next logon▪
▪Account is disabled▪
3.Create a new global security group named Help SKA.3.
4.Add the help user to the Help SKA group. Set this group as the user’s primary group.4.
5.Close Activ e  Directory Users and Computers . 5.
See Micr osoft’ s  documen t ation  for detailed steps on how to create an account.
Con figur e  the runurl program
If you do not install Cr edential  Provider softw ar e  on users’ w ork s t ations  to allow them to access the
domain help account, the runurl program, which is used to launch a web browser in kiosk mode, must
be installed on a public share accessible to computers in the domain. You can then add runurl to the
group policy for the help user, and it will be executed when the help user logs into the domain.To c on figur e  the runurl program:
1.Copy the files from the addon\Domain Login Assistant\ directory in your Bravura Security Fabric 1.
ins t allation  to the SYSVOL share on each domain controller.
You can determine the loc ation  of your SYSVOL share by typing net share  from the command
prompt on your DC.
2.Locate the gina.z  file from the skin\default\en-us\ directory and make a copy of that file to the 2.
sysvol share as well.
3.Create a text file called runurl.cfg  that contains arguments (separated by whitespace) for the 3.
runurl program. Place this file with the other runurl files on the SYSVOL share.
4.Test runurl from a command prompt on the Activ e  Directory DC by typing: 4.
  %LOGONSERVER%\sysvol\runurl.exe -cfg %LOGONSERVER%\sysvol
\runurl.cfg
Ensure that a web browser opens to the specified  URL, and that the w ork s t ation  is locked down
according to the options  you specified.
5.Test runurl from the command prompt of a w ork s t ation  logged into the domain by typing: 5.
  %LOGONSERVER%\sysvol\runurl.exe -cfg %LOGONSERVER%\sysvol
\runurl.cfg
Ensure that a browser window opens to the specified  URL, and that the w ork s t ation  is locked down
according to the options  you specified.
See runurl argument description  and example syntax.
The runurl program launches a web browser on a Windows w ork s t ation  and opens it to a specified
URL. When c on figur ed  to launch in kiosk mode the browser window fills the screen, removes all window
borders and dec or ations,  disables na vig ation,  and disables all function  keys, the [Alt]  and [Ctrl]  keys, the
Windows logo key, and any c ombination  of keys that you specify.
A major use for the runurl program is to enable users to reset their own passwords using a secure
kiosk account (SKA).
Requirements
When invoked by a local SKA or Cr edential  Provider, runurl is launched from the Login Assistant\
directory on the user’s w ork s t ation.
The following files must be located in the share or directory from which runurl is launched:
▪msgmap .txt – used to disable Windows message events on Windows w ork s t ations. ▪
▪webbrowser.dll  – used to block the [Ctrl], [Alt], and the right mouse button,  and to run the web ▪
browser. It is also used by the Cr edential  Provider.
▪pscredprov.dll  – used to block the [Ctrl], [Alt], and the right mouse button,  and to run the web ▪
browser. It is used by the Cr edential  Provider.
▪launch_ska.exe  – used to launch the SKA and invoke the runurl command. ▪Ensure that Internet Explorer 9 or higher is installed on the domain controller and all w ork s t ations  that
will access the help account. The runurl program relies on some components that are part of Internet
Explorer 9 or higher.
Usage
runurl.exe -url <URL> [<options>]
runurl.exe -cfg <filename>
The runurl program works with the following command-line arguments:
Argument Description
-url <URL> Specify the URL that will be displayed in the web browser.
-userid <userID> Bravura Security Fabric  user ID to pass through the URL.
-ntkeymap <args> Enable or disable a key or c ombinations  of keys on a
Windows w ork s t ation .
-msgmap <filename> Specify a file containing Windows message events to
block. Do not modify this file unless you are sure of what
you are doing.
-reg <filename>.r eg Load the named registry file into the registry before
t erminating  runurl. This is used to restore standard
registry entries in case runurl was launched during the
fir s t login of the help account, using a r es trictiv e  security
policy, and the user elected to not save settings  – which
means that registry changes were applied to the default
user rather than help.
-kiosk Start the web browser in kiosk mode.
-keylock Disable [ Ctrl] , [Alt] , and the right mouse button.  This is
implied by -kiosk.
-no_icw Do not pop up Internet Connection  Wizard when the user
starts up the browser the fir s t time.
-log off Log off from the w ork s t ation  after  the web browser
closes.
-run "<programname>, <args>" Run this program with these parameters before e xiting ,
and before logging off . The run option  requires quotes
around the external program name and param
arguments. If you need quotes inside of this then use a \
to escape them.
If both run and logoff are specified,  run will
execute fir s t.
-cfg <filename> If the command line is too long, use this option  to read all
arguments from this file. Write the file with the
arguments separated by white space.
-trapsesslock Trap the Windows w ork s t ation  lock notific ation  to ensure
that runurl handles locked w ork s t ations  correctly; for
example a browser displaying a User notific ations  (PSN)module notific ation  is returned to the state it was in
before the lock.
Enabling or disabling key c ombinations
You can run runurl with the -ntkeymap  option  to enable or disable keys and c ombinations  of keys
on a Windows w ork s t ation  (XP or higher). Write the arguments for -ntkeymap  using the following
syntax:
  [-] [(] [<MOD>+] <KEY> [)] [, ...]
Where:
▪- enables the keys that follow▪
▪( )  are optional  brackets (these are for f ormatting  only, they do not modify the meaning of the text) ▪
▪<MOD> specifies  one of [Alt] , [Shift] , [Ctrl] , or the Windows key <KEY > specifies  the name of the key ▪
to enable/disable
▪<KEY> can be any of the following:▪’

Examples
1.To launch a web browser in kiosk mode and open it to the Change passwords  (PSS) module, open a 1.
command prompt, and type on one line:
runurl.exe -kiosk -logoff -no_icw -trapsesslock 
-url https://<server>/<instance>/change-passwords
2.If runurl is run from a public share rather than your current w ork s t ation,  specify the UNC path to 2.
runurl in your command. If the share is located on an Activ e  Directory domain controller, open a
command prompt, and type on one line:
\\MyADDC\SYSVOL\runurl.exe -kiosk -logoff -no_icw -trapsesslock 
-url https://<server>/<instance>/change-passwords3.To disable keys on a Windows w ork s t ation  using the -ntkeymap option,  open a command prompt, and 3.
type on one line:
runurl.exe -kiosk -logoff -no_icw -trapsesslock 
-url https://<server>/<instance>/change-passwords -ntkeymap Win+F1,-
Shift+F1,Alt+Shift+F1,F1
This is the same as:
runurl.exe -kiosk  -logoff -no_icw -trapsesslock 
-url https://<server>/<instance>/change-passwords 
-ntkeymap (Win+F1),(-Shift+F1),(Alt+Shift+F1),(F1)
4.To print a list of available key names for the -ntkeymap option  on the command line, type the 4.
following in the Login Assistant\ directory:
runurl -ntkeymap ?
5.An example of a runurl.cfg  file: 5.
 -kiosk -logoff -no_icw -trapsesslock  -url http://<server>/
<instance>/?
6.To run commands from a c on figur ation  file, type: 6.
runurl -cfg runurl.cfg
Create the group policy
If you do not install Cr edential  Provider softw ar e  on users’ w ork s t ations  to allow them to access the
domain help account, you must set up a group policy to determine the c on figur ation  of a user’s desktop
environment.
To create a group policy for use with an SKA:
1.Create the help account policy. Name the group policy Help SKA.1.
For example, on Windows 2022:
a.Open Group Policy Management . a.
b.Under the forest domain sub-section,  right-click the domain object, then select Create a GPO in b.
this domain, and Link it here … .
The New GPO  dialog appears.
c.Name the group policy Help SKA . c.
d.Right click on the Help SKA policy you just created, then select Edit. d.
The Group Policy Management Editor  snap-in appears.
2.Ensure the help account policy is applied only to the Help SKA group.2.
Failure to perform this step will result in the Help Account Policy being applied to every user – making
it almost impossible to log back into the domain.
a.In the Group Policy Object Editor  snap-in, while the Policy is selected, navigate to Actions a.
> Pr operties .b.Select the Security tab. b.
c.Click Add, type Help SKA , then click OK to add the Help SKA group. c.
d.Select the Help SKA group. Under the permissions for this group, ensure that the Allow checkbox is d.
selected in the Apply Group Policy row.
e.Select the Authentic a t ed  Users group. Under the permissions for this group, clear the Allow e.
checkbox in the Apply Group Policy  row.
f.Click OK to apply the policy. f.
3.Restrict the help user’s rights by c on figuring  the group policy settings  as described in: 3.
▪ Activ e  Directory 2012, 2016, 2019, and 2022 group policy settings  (on page 1617) ▪
▪ Activ e  Directory 2008R2 group policy settings  (on page 1619) ▪
All other settings  should be left in the "Not c on figur ed"  state.
See Micr osoft’ s  documen t ation  for detailed steps on how to create a group policy.
This group policy is now in e ff ect  every time  the help user logs into the domain. Should it appear that the
group policy is not applying properly, check to ensure that your w ork s t ations  are using a primary DNS
server that supports dynamic updates.
