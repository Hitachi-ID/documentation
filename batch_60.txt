▪Assigning authorizers by user class  (on page 594) ▪▪Using group owners as authorizers  (on page 595) ▪
When r equesting  access to network resources using managed group , users can only submit requests for
groups that have at least one authorizer or group owner assigned.
Users must be loaded into the Bravura Security Fabric database before you can de fine  them as
authorizers.
You must assign enough authorizers to meet the minimum number of authorizers requirement. If you do
not do this, requests involving the resource are aut omatic ally  denied unless authorizers are assigned by a
w orkflo w  plug-in.
Inheriting  authoriz ation  c on figur ation  from the target system
You can c on figur e  target systems so that managed groups inherit the authoriz ation  c on figur ation  settings
of the target system. You can also override the c on figur ation  for a group, or add authorizers.
Enable inheritance by selecting  the Default authoriz ation  for child resources,including templates and
managed groups, will be inherited from the target system option  on the relevant Target system
in f ormation  page  (on page 494).
To override or add to the c on figur ation  for a managed group:
1.Navigate to the Managed group in f ormation  page  (on page 590). 1.
2.Set Override authoriz ation  c on figur ation  to: 2.
▪Only use inherited c on figur ation ▪
▪Do not inherit any c on figur ation ▪
▪Add to inherited c on figur ation  (default) ▪
3.Click the Authoriz ation  tab. 3.
▪If you chose to not inherit authoriz ation,  then the page shows authoriz ation  explicitly setup for the ▪
managed group; no authoriz ation  from the target system should display.
▪If you chose to add to inherited authoriz ation,  then the page displays settings  that are both ▪
inherited and explicitly set for the group.
When you choose to add to inherited authoriz ation,  the minimum number of required authorizers
will be determined by the larger value set for the managed group or target system.
Proceed to c on figur e  authoriz ation  as described in the rest of this section.

Using group owners as authorizers
Rather than assigning authorizers manually, you can c on figur e  Bravura Security Fabric  to aut omatic ally
add group owners as authorizers. Bravura Security Fabric  determines group owners using:
▪The idtrack  (on page 2431)  utility .  This program can detect: ▪
▪The group owner▪
Group owners can be either a single user or a group. If a group owner is a group, and the group
owner is assigned as an authorizer, then all its members and its child group’s members will be
added as group authorizers.
▪The users added to and removed from the group▪
▪Which accounts were added and deleted▪
▪Which groups have been added and deleted▪
▪The network resource management plugin. This plugin determines group owners by examining the▪
group’s c on figur ation  on the target system.
▪The group owners selection  plugin. This plugin is used in addition  to the resource management plugin. ▪
It can:
▪Replace the assigned owners.▪
▪Add additional  owners. ▪
▪Set owners for resources that have no owners assigned.▪
Before you begin:
▪Ensure that the Minimum number of authorizers  is greater than 0. ▪
▪Ensure that all pot ential  group owners have email addresses. ▪
▪Set the Managed group/Network resource target type for the target system on which the group ▪
resides.
This setting  determines the network resource management plugin to run. See Con figuring  general
options  (on page 494) for details.
To c on figur e  Bravura Security Fabric  to aut omatic ally  add group owners as authorizers:1.Navigate to the Managed group in f ormation  page  (on page 590). 1.
2.Enable the Aut omatic ally  add group owners as authorizers checkbox. 2.
3.Update other group options  as required  (on page 591). 3.
4.Click Manage if the group is not already managed; otherwise, click Update . 4.
Group owner selection  using a plugin
Generally, Bravura Group  determines the owners of a particular  group by examining the group’s
c on figur ation  on the target system. This is done in real time  using a network resource plugin such as
nrsmb  or nrcifs .
You can also write a group owner selection  plugin to do the following:
▪Replace the assigned owners returned by nrsmb or nrcifs . ▪
▪Add additional  owners for the user to select. ▪
▪Set owners for resources that have no owners assigned.▪
Any owner returned by the plugin will have the same requirements of an authorizer. If the owner is new,
Bravura Group  adds the owner as a s t atic  authorizers and maps him to the Bravura Group object.
Do not specify a user that is already a owner of a group. This will create duplicate owner entries for the
group.
Group owners are not necessarily the users who will authorize requests for a group. The IDSYNCH AUTH
CRITERIA MOD PLUGIN may be c onfigured  to alter the list of authorizers at the time  that the W orkflo w
Manager Service processes a request.
To use a group owner selection  plugin:
1.Click W orkflo w  > Options  > Plugins . 1.
2.Type the name of the plugin program or PSLang script in the IDACCESS OWNERS PLUGIN  field. 2.
3.Click Update . 3.
There are no shipped plugins to use with this plugin point. A sample script, idaccessauthmod.psl ,
is included in the samples\ directory. See more in f ormation  on how to write your own plugin
Requirements
See W riting  plugins  for general requirements.
Ex ecution  points
The plugin is run by View and update pr ofile  (IDR) module when users view resource details or submit
requests to modify group memberships in Bravura Group .
Input
Input passed to the plugin is as follows:
"" "" = {  "requester" = "<profile ID>" # The profile ID for the person submitting the request.
  "resourceid" = "<resource ID>" # The resource ID of the resource being viewed.
  "resourceunc" = "<network path>" # The UNC network path that is the groups are a part of.
  "group" "<long ID of the group>" = {
    "desc" = "<group desc>" # Description of the group
    "hassubgroups" = "<true|
false>" # Indicates if the group has members that are groups.
    "member" = "<true|
false>"  # Indicates the recipient's current membership status.
    "owners" "" = { # Existing owners
      "owner" = "<profile ID>" # 0 or more
    }
    "perm" "" = { # Permissions of the group for the resource selected.
      "read" = "true" # present if the group has read permission to the resource.
      "write" = "true" # present if the group has write permission to the resource.
    }
  } # 0 or more
  "recipient" "<profile ID>" = {  # The recipient of the request.
    "account" = "<account ID>" # The account ID that the groups could effect.
  }
}
The following is an example of the input sent to the plugin program:
"" "" = {
  "requester" = "CLARKDAV"
  "resourceid" = "PUB"
  "resourceunc" = "\\\\ADSRV1\\PUB\\LEGAL"
  "group" "CN=Management,OU=Groups,OU=IDM,DC=example,DC=local" = {
    "desc" = ""
    "hassubgroups" = "true"
    "member" = "false"
    "owners" "" = {
      "owner" = "BanksH"
    }
    "perm" "" = {
      "read" = "true"
    }
  }
  "group" "CN=Sales,OU=Groups,OU=IDM,DC=example,DC=local" = {
    "desc" = ""
    "hassubgroups" = "false"    "member" = "false"
    "owners" "" = {
    }
    "perm" "" = {
      "read" = "true"
    }
  }
  "recipient" "CLARKDAV" = {
    "account" = "ClarkDav"
  }
}
Output
With the addition  of extra or replacement owners, the output should mirror the input to the plugin. The
plugin output only a ff ects  the owners assigned to the r espectiv e  group.
Output passed from the plugin is as follows:
"" "" = {
  "errmsg" = "<message>" # Error message returned by the plugin
  "retval" = "0"  # Mandatory; zero is success and non-zero is failure.
  "group" "<long ID of the group>" = {
    "desc" = "<group desc>" # Description of the group
    "hassubgroups" = "<true|
false>" # Indicates if the group has members that are groups.
    "member" = "<true|
false>"  # Indicates the recipient's current membership status.
    "owners" "" = { #  KVGroup that overrides the list of owners for the group
      "owner" = "<profile ID>"   # Each owner is listed once.
    }
    "perm" "" = { # Permissions of the group for the resource selected.
      "read" = "true" # present if the group has read permission to the resource.
      "write" = "true" # present if the group has write permission to the resource.
    }
  } # A group for each one sent on input.
}
The following is an example of the expected output:
"" "" = {
  "errmsg" = ""
  "retval" = "0"  # Success
  "group" "CN=Management,OU=Groups,OU=IDM,DC=example,DC=local" = {    "desc" = ""
    "hassubgroups" = "true"
    "member" = "false"
    "owners" "" = {
      "owner" = "BanksH"
      "owner" = "SMITHBO"
    }
    "perm" "" = {
      "read" = "true"
    }
  }
  "group" "CN=Sales,OU=Groups,OU=IDM,DC=example,DC=local" = {
    "desc" = ""
    "hassubgroups" = "false"
    "member" = "false"
    "owners" "" = {
      "owner" = "SMITHBO"
    }
    "perm" "" = {
      "read" = "true"
    }
  }
}
.
Tracking changes to group membership
You can c on figur e  Bravura Security Fabric  to track changes to group membership in managed groups on
Activ e  Directory and LDAP Directory Service target systems.
When the Track changes option  is c on figur ed  for a group, Bravura Security Fabric  compares the new
group membership in f ormation,  extracted from the target system during auto discovery , with data in the
Bravura Security Fabric  database, and creates a diff set. Bravura Security Fabric  can c on figur ed  to
propagate changes on target systems or submit requests via Bravura Security Fabric 's w orkflo w  system.
You can c on figur e  the default for this setting  with AUTO TRACK MGROUP in the Resources >  Options
menu. If the setting  is enabled, new groups that are managed will use this setting  unless overridden.
You can also set this option  on the target system in f ormation  page so that all groups on the target system
are tracked.
The tracked changes are viewable in reports as part of each user’s pr ofile  history.
See Automated user adminis tr ation  (on page 2424) for more in f ormation.Handling out-of-band changes
Out-of-band changes happen when a user or a group is added to or deleted from a managed group
outside of Bravura Security Fabric . Tracking changes to group membership allows Bravura Security Fabric
to monitor managed groups for out-of-band additions  or deletions,  then aut omatic ally  submit a request
undo or redo the change via the w orkflo w  system.
Note: When out-of-band settings  are fir s t c on figur ed,  users or groups who are
already managed group members are not detected as out-of-band
additions.
To act on out-of-band changes to group membership in a managed group:
1.Navigate to the Managed group in f ormation  page  (on page 590) for the group. 1.
2.Enable the Track changes checkbox. 2.
3.From the drop-down list, select an action  to: 3.
▪Detect out-of-band additions  and aut omatic ally  generate a w orkflo w  request ▪
▪Detect out-of-band deletions  and aut omatic ally  generate a w orkflo w  request ▪
The default behavior is to take no action.  Bravura Security Fabric  can either submit a request to
undo the change, or undo the change then submit a request to redo the change via the Bravura
Security Fabric  w orkflo w  system.

9.Run auto discovery . 9.
When auto discovery  is finished,  c on figur ation  is complete. Now if any out-of-band changes are made to
group membership, then they will be detected the next time  auto discovery  is run. When an out-of-band
addition  to the group is detected:
▪A request is generated for the out-of-band user or group or join or leave the group. This request is▪
sent to the group authorizer.
▪An email is sent to the recipient (out-of-band user).▪
▪An email is sent to the group authorizer.▪
The content of these email messages can be customized using the following tags:
▪EM_WORKFLOW_REQ_INITIAL_AUTHORIZER_NEEDAUTHOOB_CONTENT_PRIMARY – This is the email▪
body that is sent to the group authorizer when a request is generated to add or remove the out-of-
band user or group.
