Activ ating  event action  options
Before you start, ensure that you have carried out steps listed in Pr epar ation  (on page 1527).
Getting  started
Locate the event system variable on the appropriate c on figur ation  page,
System variables are listed in Manage the system > Maintenance > System variables , and also various
c on figur ation  menus listed in System options  that can trigger external programs  (on page 1529). The
description  for c on figur able  events begins with "Program to execute …" , and each one has a
Con figur e  event button.
You can use the Con figur e  event  (ITSM) module  (on page 1556) to c on figur e  certain tick e t  target updates
and email notific ation,  or simply add the name of the program for scripted c on figur ation  (on page 1566).
Using the Con figur e  event (ITSM) module
The Con figur e  event  (ITSM) module provides a GUI for c on figuring  event actions.  All events that can be
c on figur ed  have a Con figur e  event button  that connects to the console, where you can use a template to
create email or add a program to run.
Certain tick e t  system interfaces can be c on figur ed  using this console, without the need to edit a PSLang
c on figur ation  script. When you use the Con figur e  event  (ITSM) module, Bravura Security Fabric
aut omatic ally  modifies  the appropriate sample c on figur ation  file and copies it to the script directory. This
applies if you want to:
▪Send email▪
▪Update tick e ts ▪Bravura Security Fabric  currently supports c on figur ation  via the Con figur e  event  (ITSM) module for
Remedy Action  Request System 7.5.x, 7.6.x and 8.0 For other interface programs, you can use the
Con figur e  event  (ITSM) module to activ a t e  the event action  option,  then write a c on figur ation  script for
the program. You can c on figur e  multiple  programs for the same event.
Only super users or product administrator s with the “Con figur e  modules” privilege can access the Con figur e
event  (ITSM) module. See Pr epar ation  (on page 1527) for other requirements.
The interface is provided by the itsm  program, included in the <instance>\cgi-bin\  directory. Unlike other
web modules the itsm console does not allow or require any c onfiguration  via the modules menu in the
Manage the system  (PSA) module. It is not related to Remedy Action  Request System ITSM, which is
supported by the agtrem-itsm  connector.
You access the console by clicking the Con figur e  event button  for the event options  found in loc ations
listed here  (on page 1529), or in Manage the system > Maintenance > System variables. An example is
shown below.
A separate window opens for the Con figur e  event  (ITSM) module (options  vary depending on your
c on figur ation):
Next: 
Now you can:
▪ Con figur e  tick e t  updates  (on page 1558) for certain target types ▪
▪Add email support  (on page 1562) if tick e t  updates are not required ▪
▪Add programs to run  (on page 1566) for systems for which aut omatic  c on figur ation  is not supported ▪
Con figuring  tick e t  updates
You can use the Con figur e  event  (ITSM) module to quickly c on figur e  your event actions  to integrate with
Remedy AR (Action  Request) System 7.5.x, 7.6.x, 8.0.x
Pr epar ation
Before c on figuring  an event action  for Remedy AR System 7.5.x, 7.6.x, 8.0.x:
1.Target a Remedy AR System 7.5+ (Ticket) system.1.
On the Target system in f ormation  page, select the appropriate target listed under IT Service
Management Systems . Note the target system ID.
2.Use the schmrem program, located in the <Program Files path>\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric 2.
\<instance>\ util\ directory, to generate the schema file following the syntax:  
schmrem*.exe -l <outputFile> -s <server>[:<port>] -u <userid> -
p <password> 
For example:
schmrem.exe -l REMTICKET.scm -s 10.10.60.65 -u remadmin -
p rempassword
generates a file REMTICKET.scm in the util directory, where REMTICKET has the same target system ID
as c on figur ed  in Step 1.
3.Copy the generated scm file to the pscfg directory. 3.
See schmrem
The schmrem program is used to generate a file containing the schema in f ormation  for the forms on
the Remedy ARS server.
This program is useful in the c on figur ation  of exit traps for events on Remedy ARS targets. The schema
in f ormation  file is also used by the Con figur e  event (itsm) module.
The form’s field  names, and the following data when available, are extracted for each field:
▪Default value▪
▪Help text▪
▪Requirement (optional  or required only) ▪
▪Type▪
▪Limits▪
▪ Enumer ation  list ▪Only optional  or required modifiable  fields  are extracted. All other fields  are ignored and not written  to
the file.
Requirements
schmrem is Win32 executable and is run on the Bravura Security Fabric  server. The Remedy ARS server
must already be available.
To enable logging for schmrem , you must add a system environment variable, IDM_SUITE_INSTANCE, to
de fine  the instance on which to log; for example: IDM_SUITE_INSTANCE = default. See your oper ating
system documen t ation  to learn how to do this. The program will be logged in
<Program Files path>\Bravura Security\Bravura Security Fabric\Logs\<instance> idmsuite.log
Usage
schmrem.exe -l <outputFile> -s <server>[:<port>] -u <userid> -
p <password>
Argument Description
-l <output filename> The name of the file to which the schema in f ormation
will be written  in KVGroup format.
-s <server>[:<port>] The Remedy ARS server (port).
-u <userid> Remedy ARS administrator ID.
-p <password> Remedy ARS administrator password.
Examples
Use the following command to send the schema in f ormation  from your server to a file.
  schmrem.exe -l REMTICKET.scm -s 10.10.60.65 -u remadmin -
p rempassword
This generates REMTICKET.scm in the util directory.
The following is an example of format of entries in the file:
     "Priority" "Priority" = {
       "default value" = "1"
       "helptext" = "Priority of the approval detail record.  This priority
                     is primarily used to determine which set of escalation
                     conditions attached to the process record will be used."
       "requirement" = "required"
       "type" = "enumeration"
       "enum" "" = {
       "0" = "Urgent"
       "1" = "Normal"
       "2" = "Low"
       }     }
for more in f ormation.
