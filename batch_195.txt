Account access request behavior
The following settings  a ff ect  privileged account access request behavior:
Bravura Privilege  account access request behavior options
Option Description
MAX CHECKOUT PASSWORD
CHANGE INTERVALThe maximum interval time,  in days, that a
checked-out account’s password stays
unchanged. Passwords are randomized once
this interval has passed.
The default is 2 days. Setting  this to 0 allows
passwords to remain unchanged until  a user
checks it in.
Once a password is checked out, it is not
randomized according to the RESOURCE
PASSWORD CHANGE INTERVAL.
It is recommended that MAX CHECKOUT
PASSWORD CHANGE INTERVAL be set to a
value greater than RESOURCE PASSWORD
CHANGE INTERVAL. This will prevent
passwords from being randomized while they
are checked out regardless of the RES
CHECKOUT PASSWORD RANDOMIZE MODE
setting.
RES CHECKIN RANDOMIZE The managed account’s password is
randomized when the user checks in.
RES CHECKOUTEXP RANDOMIZE The managed account’s password is
randomized when the check-out interval has
expired.
RES CHECKOUT LIMIT The number of users allowed to check out
account access simultaneously.
The default is 1.Option Description
RES CHECKOUT PASSWORD
RANDOMIZE MODEChoose the r andomiz ation  mode for cases
where passwords can be checked out by
multiple  users simultaneously (the RES
CHECKOUT LIMIT is greater than 1).
Choose EXTEND to have passwords
randomized when the MAX CHECKOUT
PASSWORD CHANGE INTERVAL is passed or
when all users who have checked out the
password check it in.
Choose RESET to have a password randomized
at expiry time  or whenever any user checks in.
Users who have checked out the password are
notified  that it has changed, and that they
should log in again to re-access the password.
RES DEFAULT CHECKOUT INTERVAL The default interval, in minutes, at which
managed account passwords can be checked
out. The value must be smaller than RES
MAXIMUM CHECKOUT INTERVAL and larger
than RES MINIMUM CHECKOUT INTERVAL.
This value is used to pre-load the Dur ation  and
Dur ation  unit values on the check-out access
request page and the check-out extension
request page. The default is 240 minutes, or 4
hours.
You can also set this value in the Group set
access request tab.
RES MAQ CHECKOUT ABORT Enable this setting  to disallow an account set
check-out if one of the member accounts fails
to be checked-out; for example if the check-
out limit for the individual account has been
reached.
RES MAQCHECKOUT LIMIT The number of users allowed to check out an
account set simultaneously.
The default is 1.
RES MAQ CMDFILE CLEANUP
INTERVALThe interval (in days) that account set access
command output files can exist on the
Bravura Privilege  server. The default is 365
days. This does not a ff ect  command output
files generated with "Never delete command
output file from server" option.Option Description
RES MAXIMUM CHECKOUT
INTERVALThe maximum interval, in minutes, at which
privileged access can be checked out. When
RES VALIDATE EXTENSION is disabled,
approved check-out extension requests may
exceed this limit. The default is 1440 minutes,
or 24 hours.
You can also set this value in the Group set
access request tab.
This should be less than the RESOURCE
PASSWORD CHANGE INTERVAL, in order to
prevent scheduled password changes from
being skipped.
RES MINIMUM CHECKOUT
INTERVALThe minimum interval, in minutes, at which
managed account passwords can be checked
out. The default is 5 minutes.
You can also set this value in the Group set
access request tab.
RES PORT TEST The port to use when t esting  for c onnectivity
on remote systems. The default is 445.
Set this value to "0" to disable port checks on
c onnection  failures.
RES PWD ACL PLUGIN Plugin to determine user access controls when
viewing passwords via the API.
See Using a plugin to de fine  access to
passwords  (on page 2049) for more
in f ormation.
RES REVOKE RANDOMIZE The managed account’s password is
randomized when a user’s access to it is
checked in by another user.
RES VALIDATE EXTENSION The setting  to c on figur e  if check-out extension
requests are restricted by RES MAXIMUM
CHECKOUT INTERVAL. Enable to only allow
extension requests when the current check-
out interval does not exceed the maximum
check-out interval. Disable to always allow
privileged access check-out extension
requests. The default is disabled.
You can also set this value in the Group set
access request tab.
Account access check-out external program triggers
Managed system policy exit points do not override global settings  and vice versa; however, in the case
where an exit point is c on figur ed  to run the same program from both loc ations,  only one instance of theprogram is run. The following settings  relate to account access requests and can be set in the Account
access request tab:
Bravura Privilege  account request events that launch interface programs
Option Description
RES ACCESS REVOCATION CHECKIN Program to execute when an account access
check-in action  has failed.
RES CHECKIN FAILURE A password check-in action  has failed.
RES CHECKIN SUCCESS A password check-in action  is successful.
RES CHECKOUT EXPIRY A checked out password expires.
RES CHECKOUT FAILURE A password check-out action  has failed.
RES CHECKOUT LIMIT REACHED The check-out limit is exceeded.
RES CHECKOUT SUCCESS A password check-out action  is successful.
In f ormation  passed to this exit trap includes
the status of all requests on the password.
RES REQUEST PASSWORD FAILURE Bravura Privilege  fails to generate a random
password.
RES REQUEST PASSWORD SUCCESS Bravura Privilege generates a random
password.
RES VIEW PASSWORD A product administrator requests access to a
privileged account on a managed system.
RES VIEW PASSWORD HIS A product administrator requests to access
privileged account access history on a managed
system. The trap is triggered when a user views
the access history of a managed account. The
account can viewed from either the Managed
system policies or Managed systems menus.
Viewing a privileged account’s access history
from either loc ation  triggers the exit trap.
Bravura Privilege  account set access  access request events that launch interface
programs
The following settings  relate to account set requests and can be set in the Account access request tab:
Option Description
RES MAQ ACCESS REVOCATION
CHECKINAn account set access is checked in by another
user.Option Description
RES MAQ CHECKIN FAILURE An account set access check-in has failed.
RES MAQ CHECKIN SUCCESS An account set access check-in is successful.
RES MAQ CHECKOUT EXPIRY A checked out account set access expires.
RES MAQ CHECKOUT FAILURE A checked out account set access has failed.

Generic access check-in and check-out failure retries
In the event that a generic access check-out fails for a managed account, the check-out is retried every 10
minutes (by default) until  successful or the check-out expiry time  has passed. In addition,  recipients are
able to manually retry the check-out in the Privileged access  app.
In the event that a generic access check-in fails for a managed account, the check-in is retried once every
minute (by default) until  successful or the retry timeout  (default 10 minutes) has been reached.

Group set access request behavior
The following settings  a ff ect  group set access request behavior:
Bravura Privilege  group set access requestbehavior options
Option Description
RES DEFAULT CHECKOUT INTERVAL The default interval, in minutes, at
which managed account passwords
can be checked out. The value must
be smaller than RES MAXIMUM
CHECKOUT INTERVAL and larger than
RES MINIMUM CHECKOUT
INTERVAL. This value is used to pre-
load the Dur ation  and Dur ation  unit
values on the check-out access
request page and the check-out

simultaneously.
This limit is based on a single group
set for a single managed system. The
default is 1.Option Description
RES MAXIMUM CHECKOUT
INTERVALThe maximum interval, in minutes,
at which privileged access can be
checked out. When RES VALIDATE
EXTENSION is disabled, approved
check-out extension requests may
exceed this limit. The default is 1440
minutes, or 24 hours.
You can also set this value in the
Account access request tab.

extension requests when the current
check-out interval does not exceed
the maximum check-out interval.
Disable to always allow privileged
access check-out extension requests.
The default is disabled.
You can also set this value in the
Account access request tab.

Aut omatic ally  selecting  user accounts to receive temporary group membership
Users can have many accounts from a single target or across multiple  targets. You can filt er  the amount
of accounts that are available to the user for temporary group membership. Use the RES GSET ACCT SEL
PLUGIN setting  to specify a plugin that will be used to aut omatic ally  return a single user account or a
subset of the user’s accounts.
See the sample script plugin-tmp_gset_acct_sel.psl in the sampes directory for more
details.
Determining the connector behavior of group set check-out failures
Use the RES GSET CHECKOUT AGENT POLICY setting  to specify the behavior of the connector when group
membership fails to be added to at least one group when checking out a group set from a push-mode
managed system policy. A behavior policy is used to determine how group set check-out failures should
be treated.
This policy can be one of three states:
▪Ignore failure : skips any failures encountered by the agent and c ontinues  to process subsequent ▪
groups. This is the default policy.
▪Roll back : revert any successful group memberships made before the failure was encountered. ▪
▪Abort : halt processing subsequent groups after  failure is encountered; e xisting  group memberships ▪
are left as-is.These policies do not apply when checking in a group set. Any failures encountered during check-in are
skipped and reported back, to be retried at a later time.
Group set check-in failure retries
The following system variables can be c on figur ed  in Manage the system  > Modules  > Privileged access .
In the event that an account fails to be removed from one or more groups in the group set during check-
in, the check-in can be retried at a later time.  Use RES GSET CHECKIN MAX RETRY to set the maximum
number of group set check-in retries.
You can also c on figur e  event actions  to trigger external programs when group membership has been
successfully removed after  subsequent retries or when group membership fails to be removed after
e xhausting  all retries, using RES GSET CHECKIN RETRY SUCCESS and RES GSET CHECKIN RETRY FAILURE ,
r espectiv ely .
Con figur e  event actions  RES GSET CHECKIN GRP NO SUCH MEMBER if an account loses its group
membership before the group set has been checked-in, or RES GSET CHECKIN GRP NOT FOUND if a
group in the group set cannot be located on the managed system. In these situations,  the check-in is
considered successful and will not be retried.
See Privileged access app  (on page 1251) for more details.
Checking in access
Users who are granted the "Check in access" privilege can check in the access of other users by clicking
Check in button  in Privileged access  app. This only applies to activ e  check-outs.
Superuser accounts (the ones with "All" privileges granted in Manage the system > Security > Access to
product features > Individual administrators  or Administrator groups ), are product administrators, so
they cannot get the Privileged Access  link on their login page to perform a check-in. The check-in
oper ation  is available to end users, usually a manager who is granted "revoker" privileges.
You can grant the check-in privilege to a set of users:
▪By gr anting  "Check in access" privilege in Security > Access to user pr ofiles  > Global help desk rules > ▪
<user group> .
▪Adding users to the built-in  Policies > User classes > _ACCESS_ALL_ACTIVE_CHECKOUTS  if the user ▪
class exists.
On the user group page, you can check who gets the privilege by using the Test...  button  on Membership
criteria  tab.
The check-in oper ation  carries out an emergency check-in. For privileged accounts, it immediately
randomizes any password the user has checked out. For privileged accounts checked out using SSH keys,
it removes the user’s SSH key from the target. For temporary group membership, it revokes group
memberships from all group sets the user has checked out. By default, the recipient user can still request
permission to check out privileged access. Other users who have permission to access the a ff ect ed
account are advised that the password has been changed.Requests that are in the status of checking out cannot be checked in.
Privileged access request messages
