Bravura Security Fabric  requires very little  ongoing adminis tr ation.  It is advisable, however, to monitor
server health.
Monitoring is primarily done on the Bravura Security Fabric  server. You should:
▪Check service health, using the Maintenance > Services menu option  in the Manage the system (PSA) ▪
module.
▪Monitor CPU load and virtual memory c onsumption  on the Bravura Security Fabric  server. Both should ▪
be stable (change only very slowly) and signific an tly  below the total resources available on the server.
▪Monitor the amount of free disk on the Bravura Security Fabric  server. Bravura Security Fabric  will fail ▪
if it runs out of disk space.
▪Check the contents of the Bravura Security Fabric  log file (on page 2776) for errors and to ensure that ▪
the auto discovery  process was successful.
▪Review recent contents of the Bravura Security Fabric  session log, by running reports ( Reports > ▪
System oper ation ) on user and administrator events. See REPORTS  (on page 2891) for details.
▪Customize the Health check monitor  (on page 2795), which is installed by default, to suit your ▪
environment. Health check monitor will periodically report the status of the following:
▪Admin events▪
▪ Applic ation  crashes ▪
▪Disk space usage▪
▪Health Check password c on flict  count ▪
▪Long running processes▪
▪Availability of Bravura Security Fabric  services ▪
▪URL accessibility▪
Additionally ,  your database administrator should check the size of the Bravura Security Fabric  database
regularly. Unexpected results may occur if the Bravura Security Fabric  data exceeds the maximum
database size or tablespace limit. It is expected that the Bravura Security Fabric  database will grow over
time;  however, with the e x ception  of the session log (sesslogtable), rapid increases or decreases in size
may indicate a problem.
Monitoring hardware resources
It is important to ensure each applic ation  node and database server does not run out of resources. For
example; Bravura Security Fabric  cannot update the database if the database server runs out of disk
space or running out of physical RAM can cause the database processing to slow down dr amatic ally  as
the OS swaps RAM to disk.
Most hardware vendors provide monitoring softw ar e  and there are many third- party applic ations
available that can be useful in c onjunction  with various settings  in Bravura Security Fabric  itself.
Hardware monitoring includes:▪Monitor RAM availability  (on page 2775) ▪
▪Disk space  (on page 2775) ▪
Consult the relevant vendor’s documen t ation  for more in f ormation  about how to c on figur e  the
monitoring.
Monitor RAM availability
▪Monitor the available RAM on the applic ation  nodes and database servers and set alerts if the ▪
available RAM falls under acceptable levels.
▪Consider aut omatic ally  r es t arting  any process or service whose memory use grows over time,  during ▪
low usage time;  for example:
▪The ajax service ▪
▪Windows svchost service ▪
▪SearchUI process ▪
▪The MsMpEng processes ▪
▪msgsvc service when Bravura Security Fabric  applic ation  node is under heavy use ▪
Disk space
Con figur e  monitoring of disk space availability on all nodes and database servers and set alerts when the
disk space falls below a certain level.
As historical data is gathered in Bravura Security Fabric , the backend database will c ontinually  grow. The
disk loc ation  where MSSQL stores its files has to be at least 50% empty at all times.  If the server is not
provisioned based requirements allocated space will have to be periodically increased by database
administrators. See Server requirements  (on page 196) for the requirement details.
Bravura Security Fabric  has a health check feature  (on page 2795), which monitors the C: drive and sends
notific ations  about it. If the backend MSSQL database is installed on the same server, with its' file on a
diff er en t  drive, health check can be c on figur ed  to monitor that other drive.
However, if the database files are on a diff er en t  server, and the drive where the files are cannot be
mapped to the Bravura Security Fabric  node for health check to be used, other tools will have to be used
to alert Bravura Security Fabric  admins of the impending out-of-space situation.
Whether r eplic ation  is c on figur ed  or not, the applic ation  node’s iddb.cfg file contains a setting  that
will stop all database-related applic ation  processes if available disk space drops under a certain level. It is
recommended not to manually modify the c on fig  file, but in some cases it may be required.
The default level of "max_disk_space_percentage is 90%. When the available disk space reaches 10% of
the total disk space, the applic ation  will stop working.
For very large disks, that setting  is too small; for example, 10% of 1TB is 100GB. In extreme cases, the
90% value can be increased as long as the available free space is still more than the size of the database
files as mentioned  above.Note: The iddb.cfg records the max percentage the database service will still
work, while the healthcheck MIN_PERCENT_FREE setting  is the opposite.
When increasing the setting  in iddb.cfg (for example to 95), decrease the
one in healthcheck (for that example, to 5).
If the instance is replicated, that setting  can be c on figur ed  in the WebUI in the nodes Con figur ation  tab
under Manage the system > Maintenance >  Database r eplic ation .
Note: The tr ansaction  file itself can grow daily to more than the size of the
database itself.
About the Bravura Security Fabric Log
The Logging Service ( idmlogsvc ) maintains a log of Bravura Security Fabric  program e x ecution.  This
includes web modules, services, exit programs, plugins, connectors, and command-line programs. By
default the log is stored in a text file, idmsuite.log , within the Logs directory. This directory is
rotated nightly; rotated logs are named in the following way:
1.Current: <instance> 1.
2.Most recent for specific  date, except the current log: <instance> .<yyyy> -<mm> -<dd> 2.
3.Log rotated more than once for a specific  date: <instance> .<yyyy> -<mm> -<dd> -<hhmmss> .<SerialNo> . 3.
For example, if the instance is ExampleCo , logs are named:
ExampleCo 
ExampleCo.2016-02-28
ExampleCo.2016-02-28-134020.0
ExampleCo.2016-02-28-114020.0
ExampleCo.2016-02-27   
ExampleCo.2016-02-26   
ExampleCo.2016-02-25
In the above example, the log was rotated 3 times  in 2016-02-28 and the directories are in a most recent
sequence order.
Log entries are, in general, composed of multiple  lines or messages written  in the format:
<date> <time>  - [<lsid>] <program> [<process ID>,<thread ID>] <level>: [<range>] <message text> 
where:
lsid is the logging session ID. Certain programs, such as web modules, include a session ID in their
log entries. All lines with the same logging session ID belong to the same event.
level is the level or severity of the message. This can be one of: Error, Warning, Notice,  Info, Debug,
or Verbose.range is the range of characters from the log message included in the log entry. This is shown only
when long log messages are spread between multiple  log entries. Since each log entry includes
500 characters of the log message, the range for the fir s t entry is [0 .. 499] .

Viewing Bravura Security Fabric system logs
You can use the Maintenance > Systems logs page in the Manage the system  (PSA) module to view the
current Bravura Security Fabric  systems log, as well as previously rotated logs.
Note: The date and time  recorded in the Bravura Security Fabric  logs are based
on the settings  of Windows servers where Bravura Security Fabric  is
installed. You can view the current Bravura Security Fabric  server date and
time  from the System logs page.
To search the logs:
1.Click Maintenance > System logs . 1.
Bravura Security Fabric  displays the System logs page.
2.If necessary, enter search criteria to display only specified  log entries: 2.
Log message Type a string or a regular expression that represents the log message you want to view.
You can use + and - symbols to include keywords from the search; for example
+ update operation - unlock
includes the keywords update and operation , and excludes unlock .
If you want to use a regular expression, you must also select the corresponding Regular
expression checkbox.
Process Type a string or a regular expression that represents the process you want to view. If you
want to use a regular expression, you must also select the corresponding Regular
expression checkbox.

Using Regular Expressions
Regular expressions provide a way to identif y  patterns  of text in strings.
Bravura Security Fabric  uses regular expressions to:
▪Match and block invalid passwords.▪
▪ Identif y  users who it should not manage. ▪
▪Extract text from Telnet/TN3270 screens in Telnet connector scripts.▪
▪Extract text from the output of password hashing programs in DBMS connector scripts.▪
Regular expressions use a shorthand of literal characters and special characters to de fine  a pattern  in a
precise and compact way. Literal characters are case sensitiv e.  The regular expression parser used by
Bravura Security Fabric  uses the following special characters in literal strings:
Character Purpose Example Match
. Matches any single
charactera.c aac , abc , a1c , a2c
^ Beginning of a line ^hat hat , hatch , not
chat
$ End of a line hat$ hat , chat , not
hatch
| Alt ernation job|task job or task
( ) Grouping job(12 |34) job12 or job34
\ Treat the following
special character
literally\$5\.6\\7 $5.6\7
The | alternates the longest possible string. That is, it matches job or task , and matches both jotask
and jobask .
Grouping with ( ) limits the alternate branches.Character sets
Character sets
You can de fine  a set of characters within a string. Character sets match any single character enclosed in
square brackets [ ] . For example:
Expression Match
j[oa]n jon or jan
Use the - character between two characters in a set to indicate a range. A - character outside of a set,
or at the beginning or end of a set, is treated literally. For example:
Expression Match
[a-c] a, b, or c
[1-3] 1, 2, or 3
[ab-] a, b, or -
[B-D]-3 B-3 , C-3 , or D-3
If the fir s t character in the set is ^, then the character set matches any character that is not in the list. For
example:
Expression Match
[^oa] Any character except o and a
All other special characters lose their meaning when included in a character set. For example:
Expression Match
^[^*\+.-] Line must not start with *, \, +, .,or -
To include a literal ] in the character set, make it the fir s t character in the set. It can also be excluded by
following ^. The ] character is also treated literally outside of a set. For example:
Expression Match
[^]a-] Any character besides ], a, and -
[]a] ] or a
[a]] a]
Quantifier s
Quantifier s
You can specify quantities  of character sets, grouped characters, or individual characters. The quantifier s
*, +, ?, and { } act on the preceding set, group, or individual character.
Character Purpose Example Match
* Specifies  0 or more
c onsecutiv e  occurrencesab*c ac, abc , abbbbc+ Specifies  1 or more
c onsecutiv e  occurrencesab+c abc , abbbbc
? Specifies  0 or 1 occurrence colou?r (wo)?man color or colour
woman or man
{x} Exactly <x> occurrences ab{4}c abbbbc
{x,y} At least <x>, no more than
<y> occurrencesab{2,4}c abbc , abbbc , abbbbc
{x,} At least <x> occurrences ab{2,}c abbc , abbbc
{,x} No more than <x>
occurrencesab{,2}c ac, abc , or abbc
Shorthand expressions
Shorthand expressions
The following expressions are shorthand for longer or more complex regular expressions:
Expression Purpose Example Match
[:alpha:] Matches must consist of
letter s.[:alpha:]8,16 aBcmGLeEhhi
[:digit:] Matches must consist of
digits. [:digit:] is equivalent
to [:d:] and \d.[[:digit:]]+ 2962954576
[:upper:] Matches must consist of
uppercase characters.[[:upper:]
[:digit:]]+9DDD4MLAG13
[:alnum:] Matches must be
alphanumeric. [:alnum:] is
short hand for [a-zA-Z0-9]
in the ascii character set,
but the use of [:alnum:] is
preferred for c ompatibility
with other languages and
character sets.[:alnum:]7[^[:digit:]] a3dM9DD+
Examples
Examples
Only allow letter s,  numbers, e x clamation  point, and
